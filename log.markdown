While on vacation, there are some things I'd like to do more of each day.\* Starting this Friday the 13th, August 2021 I'm tracking to see if I can do them daily for at least a month.

\*_30 minutes of running or biking, 30 minutes of pilates, 10 minutes of meditation, a daily journal entry, and a 10 p.m. bedtime. Classic productivity dork stuff._
