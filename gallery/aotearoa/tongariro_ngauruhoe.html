      <h3>Mount Ngauruhoe</h3>
      <p>
        One of the four volcanoes nearby on this walk. Tourists are no longer
        welcome to climb to the peak, as it is sacred to the hapū Ngāti Hikairo
        Ki Tongariro. I was chatting with a few guys over lunch near the base,
        and they decided to go up anyway. I called them out but they ignored me.
        What are ya gonna do.
