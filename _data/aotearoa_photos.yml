  title: A Sunset in Panmure
  description: There are often nice sunsets visible from the <em>belvedere</em>. I like the powerlines that are in the way.

  title: Two Sparrows Having a Bath
  description: I'm pretty sure they're sparrows. The Hamilton Gardens had about eight differently themed gardens. This one was the backyard kitchen garden. I wish.

  title: A Baby Rabbit
  description: This little bunny was tiny! This garden was especially calming.

  description: Two mallards this time. In a little stream that had a bridge going over it.

  description: It's rewarding to notice plants in all their different stages of life.

  title: P훮taka
  description: Everyone is really keen to explain to you that these things are raised to stop rats getting in. I overheard three people say this.

  title: Tongariro Crossing T+30 Minutes
  description: We did this walk during easter, so there were lots of people. I didn't really know what to expect with the crossing; I was pleasantly surprised at how diverse the terrain was.

- filename: tongariro_soda_springs.jpg
  title: The Soda Springs
  description: This was an optional detour off the main trail. A funny lady who had been drinking from the stream came up to me wished me a good hike.

- filename: tongariro_fog.jpg
  title: Clouds
  description: The wind started to pick up and blow clouds in. It felt very volcanic.

- filename: tongariro_ngauruhoe.jpg
  title: Mount Ngauruhoe
  description: One of the four volcanoes nearby on this walk. Tourists are no longer welcome to climb to the peak, as it is sacred to the hap큰 Ng훮ti Hikairo Ki Tongariro. I was chatting with a few guys over lunch near the base, and they decided to go up anyway. I called them out but they ignored me. What are ya gonna do.

  title: The Most Yonic Rock Formation I've Ever Seen
  description: I was quickly ushered into the club of tens of thousands of people who have seen this thing and thought "Wow, that mountain has labia."

- filename: tongariro_lake_rotoaira.jpg
  title: Tongariro Descent
  description: Another part of the crossing. The scenery changed every kilometer, as the altitude and humidity became more conducive for plantlife.

- filename: tongariro_trees.jpg
  title: The Last Stretch
  description: The final part of the crossing was a classic bush tramp. I really liked this part, despite being quite tired. I spent far too long fishing out a plastic bottle with my walking sticks that had fallen off the track into a cluster of ferns while two birds hopped around and watched me.

  description: The next day I went on a little bike ride around the Aratiatia walkway.

  description: This stream came out of a hot spring, it ran for a few kilometres and was steaming hot.

- filename: taupo_geothermal.jpg
  title: Taupo Geothermal
  description: Along the ride there were lots of these sorts of pipelines venting steam. I wish I could have gotten some better shots of this one but, boiling hot moat.

  title: Rimu Sunlight
  description: I'm actually not very good at recognizing native plants. I've got a flash card app to help rectify the situation, but for the next few months there is a chance that this isn't actually a Rimu tree.

- filename: paihia_tree.jpg
  title: Trunk
  description: This was at the end of the lookout along the School Road Trail in Paihia. I stayed there for about two hours, maybe only eight other people walked past. COVID's been good for touristic privacy, I suppose.

  title: Kawau
  description: Sentinel of the Paihia rock pools. I had to clamber over a bunch of them (rock pools, not shags) in jandals to get close enough.

  title: Chicken Park
  description: This campervan park outside the beginning of the Haruru Falls trail had a couple dozen chickens in it. They were very friendly to me, although a few were showing signs of the pecking order.

- filename: haruru_lichen.jpg
  title: Cyan Lichen
  description: Many of these photos are just closeups of some organic system. I love them. For all the work that generative artists do to create something beautiful with an algorithm, it's entirely superficial compared to what is produced by nature.

- filename: haruru_sediment.jpg
  title: Shells in Sediment
  description: This was only a small elevation from where the river currently is, now thriving with terrestrial plantlife. I wonder how long this sort of thing takes, and how much of the world's coastal calcium deposits we owe to mollusks that got hung out to dry.

  title: Just Two Regular Mushrooms
  description: Been reading <em>Entangled Life</em> recently. These cuties now feel a lot more imcomprehensible.

- filename: haruru_tree.jpg
  title: Tree in Light
  description: The sun poked through for some nice contrast just as I rounded the corner. I find a lot of forest shots fail to capture what it's like actually being there. The parallax is missing.

  title: Some Kind of Beach Grass
  description: Look. I'm not a botanist, I just liked the way the golden tips of the stems looked.

  description: A runner zipped past me here as I hunched over to take a photo of some bird shit.

  description: There really is a near-fractal level of detail in everything around us. Ten thousand years ago I'd have been an animist for sure.

  description: It was an overcast day, but felt nice to get out of the bush and on my way to Waitangi.

- filename: waitangi_possum.jpg
  title: Allow Me To Introduce,
  description: Dead possum. I imagine anyone who's reading this knows me personally and thus likely knows that I've taken a great interest in daughterless gene drives as of late. I can get as mad at the possums wrecking our ecology as much as any New Zealander, but it doesn't bring me joy to think of them dying of poisoning, or trapping. I'd rather they all die of natural causes, as virgins.
