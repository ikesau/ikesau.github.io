    yu-gi-oh was so smart. transformers had already proven you could forcibly
    extract money from parents by pretending your advertisements for children's
    toys comprised a television show, but hasbro still had to pay for injection
    moulding. what if they just printed the money instead?
  </p>
  <p>
    in the yu-gi-oh tv show<sup>1</sup>, the main thing that all the characters
    do is play the card game yu-gi-oh<sup>2</sup>. all disagreements are
    resolved via dueling<sup>3</sup>, and even though this is shown to favour
    the rich, at the end of most episodes the child protagonists justly win and
    you feel an urge to go to the toy store and purchase yu-gi-oh cards.

  <p>
    the show was transitional, a ratcheting down of my unlimited childhood
    imagination to something more grounded in the real world. not that it was
    completely tethered to reality. beyond the porn-levels of plot to justify
    the action, in the beginning, the writers of the show didn't really
    understand the rules of the game - the early duels feature flagrant rules
    violations and completely hallucinated mechanics. nevertheless, i loved it.
    the writers were right in one sense: the rules were unimportant<sup>4</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    to illustrate this, my childhood best friend and i had sheets of cardstock
    that we would make our own cards with. Shadow Dragon, Night Dragon, Dark
    Dragon, Lightning Dragon, Dark Lightning Dragon. i wish i had them still. we
    didn't make any spell cards. all that mattered was that your cards had cool
    (dragon) names and drawings (of dragons) and that you didn't have
    <em>too</em> many cards that were stronger than anything in the show. that
    was another implicit rule - dramatic suspense requires unpredictability.
    even as eight-year olds we understood that our make-believe yu-gi-oh would
    make no sense if we were completely overpowered.

  <p>
    and so the show got us all the way through the funnel but wasn't able to
    convert. to us, it wasn't where the cards came from or if we'd paid for
    them. it was if they were fun to play with.
  </p>
  <p>
    skip forward 8 years and i'm in high school playing magic the gathering with
    my friends. magic was the inspiration for yu-gi-oh, released in 1993, the
    first trading card game of its kind. by now the game has a pro scene, a
    janky official computer game, and a thriving secondary market where people
    buy individual cards to construct decks with. blah blah. you can just read
    this

    if you care about this stuff.<sup>5</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    my four friends and i were buying cheap cards online. we didn't have much
    money, and shipping from the U.S. was expensive. this balanced our group,
    because no one could afford the really powerful cards.<sup>6</sup>. we each
    had one deck until that got old then someone bought a new one and we'd play
    all the matchup permutations we could until it got boring enough for the
    cycle to repeat. over two years i spent maybe $300 doing this. eventually i
    moved and sold my cards to a game store for $50. i stopped thinking about
    magic much at all.

  <p>
    but now it's now. i've been thinking about magic again. i pitched the idea
    to my girlfriend, we got some introductory decks, and we had a hell of a
    time! it's a fun game! then the call of new cards began. familiar with where
    it led, i started to contemplate the alternative: all the cards are
    available as jpegs online. why not just use a home printer and scissors for
    the cards i want? a little budget cutting could save me a lot of money!
  </p>
  <p><strong>why doesn't everyone do this?</strong></p>
  <p>
    i searched the internet a little to try and find an answer, but didn't see
    anyone explain the complete incentive structure as i've come to understand
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    it helps to understand that proxy magic is a mix of forgery and piracy:
    forgery denotes that the value of the object comes from people believing it
    to be authentic, whereas piracy is about stealing<sup>7</sup> a thing that
    has instrumental value. this isn't an airtight distinction, but it explains
    the psychology of, say, branded clothes quite well.<sup>8</sup> a large part
    of the value of having a shirt with a brand logo on it is to show people
    that you can afford the shirt with the logo on it. and if you're caught
    wearing a fake, you need to be called out by the people who've paid the full
    price because otherwise you'll dilute the esteem <em>they</em> get.
  </p>
  <p>
    the thing is, i don't give a SHIT about what people think about how much
    paper i have tied up in my cardboard - i'm all about that instrumental
    value. i just want to play magic.
  </p>
  <p>
    but like with branded clothes, it's in many people's interests to not let me
    do this: magic is a trading card game. new cards enter circulation is
    through gambling on packs of 15 cards and trading them.<sup>9</sup
    ><sup>10</sup> gambling is addictive and people get hooked on pulling rare
    mythics, rationalized by the lie that they're developing a portfolio which
    will appreciate. this in turn, fuels a speculative secondary economy in
    which local game stores invest in inventory to try and make profit on the
    fluctuations of card prices.<sup>11</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    all of this depends on us agreeing that we need to pay money for magic
    cards, because upstream is the fact that hasbro needs to pay
    <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/">mark rosewater</a>. if he stops
    getting paid, he'll stop designing new cards and then there'll be no new
    releases, no hype cycle, no profit margin for local game stores, no magic
    journalists, no sponsorship deals from companies that make playmats, no
    tournaments to fill event centres. if people stop cracking packs, the house
    of cards will come crashing down. people who have bought into the game have
    internalized this logic and will probably try to police you if you bring
    forgeries into any place that has a commercial interest in magic.

  <p>
    but i'm not interested in going to any of those places. i just want to play
    kitchen table, so is there any other reason not to use proxies? so far, the
    only negative i've found is that when every card is free, it's tempting to
    print some of the really strong expensive decks and these are actually less
    fun to play. a deck that performs well in the pro scene needs to be very
    consistent, which makes the experience of playing them kind of monotonous.
    still. i'm glad i didn't pay $500 to learn that lesson.
  </p>
  <p>
    thus, arbitrarily, self-servingly, i'm okay with being a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem">free-rider</a>.
    there are 30,000 unique magic cards. if enough people join me and bring
    hasbro to financial demise, there will still be plenty of jpegs to go
    around. anarchic homebrew magic would still exist (even though i admit it
    would probably never be as well-designed and cohesive as the game is today)
    and if people really wanted, i'm sure mark rosewater and co. could start a
    new patreon-funded organization to design copyleft cards indefinitely.

  <p>
    would that work? i have no idea, but we'll never find out as long as magic
    exists in its current form, so i'm happy to play the game for free until we
    maybe one day find out.

    <p><span>1</span> it was a manga first but i never read it</p>
    <p>
      <span>2</span> i guess it's called "Duel Monsters" but no one says that.
      the game is so hegemonic that everyone says "i challenge you to a duel"
      and everyone understands.
    </p>
    <p><span>3</span> much like the old west</p>
    <p><span>4</span> for 8-year olds</p>
    <p><span>5</span> and if you don't, why are you even reading this?</p>
    <p>
      <span>6</span> we'd also all share our decks with each other. if you
      shared your deck and it won, you'd recieve some residual clout.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>7</span> or reproducing, which is the argument of intellectual
      property and the underpinnings of this entire post, but i can't be fucked
      to further expound.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>8</span> imagine writing "nike" with a sharpie on a tshirt. It
      wouldn't actually confer the
      <a href="https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/"
        >culturally imprinted value</a
      >
      of an authentic nike shirt, so it's not piracy. it's barely even forgery
      because of how obviously illegimate it is. honestly, it would mostly be
      comedy. i would love to see someone wearing a hand drawn nike shirt.
      torrenting a netflix show, on the other hand, <em>is</em> piracy. the
      designation acknowledges that the object has instrumental value and that
      value has been transferred. i can watch the show with friends and we'd all
      enjoy it just as much as we would if the data was coming from netflix's
      servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>9</span> generally the more powerful a card is, the fewer are
      printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>10</span> nowadays they just buy them from enormous online stores
      that have hundreds of thousands of cards in their inventory
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>11</span>
      this second hand market twists hasbro's arm. hasbro has to be careful
      which cards they print lest they cause prices to crash, hurting local game
      stores and chilling further investment. to be free of their role as
      central bank would allow them to be as greedy as they want, so it's no
      wonder that hasbro is investing heavily in their modern computer game
      version of the game. there, they can monopolize the market and set prices
      exactly as they'd like, employing all the exploitive dirty tricks typical
      of the free-to-play video game industry. people are getting pretty
      disillusioned with this, but, y'know, addiction.
