    i don't remember how i found this band (maybe through
    <a href="https://lithics.bandcamp.com/track/still-forms-2">lithics</a>?),
    but i've loved their shtick ever since. repetitive, syncopated & coarse
    guitars playing around in one chord accompanied by drum chaos. Matt
    Radosevich's simple vocal parts cast the cacophany in an innocent light.

  <p>
    all the songs are from the EPs the band has released over the last 6 years
    and it's that weird thing where i already have a deep affinity for the EP
    versions so now it's like this album is my new stepdad that i have to learn
    to coexist with.

    here are the lyrics to seven winds. there's also a very good
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyTLf5YMm6Y&t=470">live version</a>
    performed during a "<a href="https://www.spoilerroom.net/">spoiler room</a>"

    <p>seven winds blow hard</p>
    <p>seven breezes blow on</p>
    <p>wind chimes, tin cans, rope lights</p>
    <p>rattle in the meantime</p>
    <p>seven winds blow hard</p>

    <p>rattle in the meantime</p>
    <p>and i won't be caught</p>
    <p>and i won't be caught this time uncovered</p>
    <p>and i'll bide my time till i've crossed safely now</p>
    <p>till i've crossed safely now</p>
