<p>this guy killlllllllls it</p>
<p>i was curious about how people would play this track, but found most people stylized the track too far away from its trap roots for my liking.</p>
<p>this one stays faithful, at least during the verse with triplets on the hats. it's alo really flashy. but it's SO tight and he nails the triple kick at the end which is a miracle.</p>
