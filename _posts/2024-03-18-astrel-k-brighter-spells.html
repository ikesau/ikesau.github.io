    a standout from
    <a href="https://astrelk.bandcamp.com/album/the-foreign-department"
      >a new album by rhys edwards</a
    >, vinyl dust in the opening four bars barely prepares you for the massive
    attack bassline that knocks down the door.

    <p>a crisis averted!</p>
    <p>i’ll cross the line again</p>
    <p>a crisis averted</p>
    <p>a child from the future shall write again</p>
    <p>a curse!</p>
    <p>yourself!</p>
    <p>But let in the light, let in</p>
    <p>on concrete blocks</p>
    <p>on spiral stairs</p>
    <p>more self assured in brighter spells</p>
    <p>the cat came in</p>
    <p>the moment’s here and it’s murderous!</p>
    <p>I lost my foot on final stair</p>
    <p>tumbled back to where i came</p>
    <p>the hallway sleeps another kväll</p>
    <p>
      on andra våningen is where brighter spells and times of trouble, entwine,
      then hide, then end
    </p>
    <p>A conscience commuting</p>
    <p>a dead end or one way route?</p>
    <p>The context is worthy, astute observation of yellow suit</p>
    <p>they cast a line</p>
    <p>a call to bite</p>
    <p>a reel to turn</p>
    <p>a revert to type</p>
    <p>a table turned</p>
    <p>a lesson learned and it's murderous</p>
    <p>You lost your foot on final stair</p>
    <p>tumbled back to where you came</p>
    <p>the hallway sleeps another kväll, on andra våningen is where</p>
    <p>maybe you’re right</p>
    <p>but that’s no way to go about it</p>
    <p>I’m likely a light that was off but now is on</p>

    maybe this is less surprising if you're not familiar with previous projects
    <a href="https://ulrikaspacek.bandcamp.com/">ulrika spacek</a> or
    <a href="https://tripwires.bandcamp.com/album/watermelancholia-2"
      >tripwires</a
    >, where the low end was almost always supplied by a bass guitar, but rhys
    has a shit ton of instruments now and they're spread out all over this song.
    drums, synths, guitar, tambo, sure. but then strings? and a piano and idk i
    think i'm hearing a xylophone in here. meticulously arranged! parts swoop in
    and out, never intrusively.
  </p>
  <p>
    i particularly like the snear in his voice during the line "more self
    assured in brighter spells" and the strained soft little overdubs in the
    chorus.
  </p>
  <p>
    kväll is swedish for "evening", and andra våningen is "second floor" - i'll
    probably simmer on the lyrics a little longer before i feel confident
    interpreting them, beyond that i suppose they're the thoughts on
    "progress"/"direction"/"movin' on up" of a depressive musician that
    expatriated to stockholm.
  </p>
  <p>i hope rhys is having a brighter spell at the moment.</p>
