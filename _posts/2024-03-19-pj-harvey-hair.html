    my brother introducted pj harvey to me when i was young and i'm very
    grateful to have been able to listen to her music throughout my life
  </p>
  <p>
    the 12/8 over shuffled-5/4 polyrhythm that kicks this song off (and returns
    throughout) is basically the core idea of any music i play that i find
    interesting
  </p>
  <p>
    the fact that such different rhythmic feelings can syncrhonise so
    perfectly... i think this is what mathemeticians feel when they think about
    euler's identity
