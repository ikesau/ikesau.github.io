        In 2019, a large chandelier was installed underneath Granville Street
        Bridge, to aesthetically enhance the area. It was controversial at the
        time, a symbol of what's wrong with luxury condo development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used to work on Granville Island, so when I visited Vancouver in early
        2025, I wanted to walk around my old stomping grounds and pay the
        chandelier a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, upon walking to where I remembered it being installed, it
        had been removed, presumably for maintenance reasons. Disappointed, I
        went home and lamented to my sister.
    </p>
    <p>She replied, "Oh, it's not there anymore? By the north entrance?"</p>
    <p>"By the south, you mean. And no, there's nothing."</p>
    <p>
        "It was never at the south entrance. It was installed at the north
        entrance."
    </p>
    <p>"No? What are you talking about?"</p>
    <p>
        I argued with my sister - who lives in Vancouver and has been to
        Granville Island countless times in the last 6 years - that she was
        wrong. I had seen that chandelier many times while working near the
        south entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
        After 10 minutes, she was unconvinced but sympathetic, and so we took to
        the internet, where every single article, blog, photo, or video we could
        find confirmed that the chandelier was installed and
        <em>had-only-ever-been-located</em> at the north entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
        I reeled. This was a conspiracy. I felt
        <em>so</em> sure that I had seen the chandelier at the south entrance,
        and that this was all some horrible kind of gaslighting.
    </p>
    <p>
        But after scouring through every obscure source of evidence I could
        think of, I had nothing to back me up.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, reluctant and dissatisfied, I quietened.</p>
    <p>
        I went to the north entrance a few days later. The chandelier was there.
        I looked around. I had no memory of this part of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
        Months have passed. I'm pretty sure what happened is that the ceiling of
        the bridge looks the same from both entrances, and I saw so many photos
        of the chandelier with the familiar ceiling of the bridge behind it that
        I assumed they must have been taken from the south entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, I worked on Granville Island in 2014, and the chandelier was
        installed in 2019. This was an embarrassingly obvious fact that should
        have immediately disqualified my argument, but I couldn't think about
        that in the midst of an epistemic crisis/assault on my credibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        So now I have direct evidence to the contrary, and a plausible story as
        to how I got so confused in the first place. I no longer believe the
        chandelier was ever installed near the south entrance. And yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        I <em>still have the memory</em> of walking past it during my lunch
        break.
