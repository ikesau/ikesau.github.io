  <p>
    mosa lina is a platformer game where you solve randomly generated
    level-puzzles using fickle and oblique tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    imagine <em>KidPix</em> meets <em>Baba is You</em> meets <em>N+</em> meets

  <p>
    there are around 20 different tools in total, but each time you start the
    game, you get a smaller subset of the 20 to beat a suite of 10 randomly
    generated levels. each time you attempt a level, you get 3 tools from your
    subset to use. each time you die (or choose to skip), you spawn in one of
    the remaining unsolved levels with a new hand of 3 tools. when you beat the
    suite, you do it all again.
  </p>
  <p>
    the chaos and impermenance of the game very naturally encourages
    experimentation. some levels feel impossible to solve with the hand you're
    dealt, but over time you discover interactions between tools and develop new
    intuitions for how to best go about beating a level (solveability is not
    guaranteed!)
  </p>
  <p>
    here's an example of me failing at a level, because one of the tools i got
    (delete) erased the platform i wanted to run on and i fell down the hole

    here's an example of me beating a level by using the phaser tool to pass
    through the spikey boulders, collecting the fruit, and then hopping back to
    the finish portal. (i also shoot the bamboo tool because i wanted to see
    what it did.)

    the game is light on overarching objectives. mostly it's about thinking
    creatively, encouraged by the reticent, wry, and whimsical tone that comes
    through from the developers.

    and because "figuring out the game" <em>is</em> the game, even playing it
    for 20 minutes feels like i'm playing it right, which is really nice in this
    world of meticulous and mechanically dense games.
