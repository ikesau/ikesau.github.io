  <p>
    mosa lina is a platformer game where you solve randomly generated
    level-puzzles using fickle and oblique tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    imagine <em>KidPix</em> meets <em>Baba is You</em> meets <em>N+</em> meets

  <p>
    there are 24 tools in total, but each time you start the game, you get a
    smaller subset of the 24 to beat a suite of 9 randomly generated levels.
    each time you attempt a level, you get 3 tools from your subset to use. each
    time you die (or skip), you spawn in one of the remaining unsolved levels
    with a new set of 3 tools. when you beat the suite, you do it all again.
  </p>
  <p>
    the chaos and impermenance of the game very naturally encourages
    experimentation. even if you have no idea what to do on a particular level,
    you have to try
    <em>something</em> to move on, even if that something is using each of your
    tools once and then jumping to your death. and so, in the beginning, 95% of
    the levels feel impossible to solve with the hand you're dealt, but over
    time you discover new interactions between tools and develop new intuitions
    about how to approach obstacles. eventually, only 90% of the levels feel
    impossible. i get the sense that it will never be 0% - one of the game's
    tooltips is
    <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold"
      >hard locks are possible</span
    >
    - but that's a good thing. it keeps the game feeling pleasantly unserious.

    here's an example of me failing at a level, because one of the tools i got
    (delete) erased the platform i wanted to run on and i fell down the hole

    here's an example of me beating a level by using the phaser tool to pass
    through the spikey boulders, collecting the fruit, and then hopping back to
    the finish portal. (i also shoot the bamboo tool because i wanted to see
    what it did.)

    the game is light on instruction or overarching objectives. mostly it's
    about thinking creatively, encouraged by the reticent, wry, and whimsical
    tone that comes through from the developers.

    and because "figuring out the game" <em>is</em> the game, even playing it
    for 20 minutes feels like i'm playing it right. it's lovely.
