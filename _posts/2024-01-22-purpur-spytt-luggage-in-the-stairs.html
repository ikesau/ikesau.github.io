  <p>the light has started to decline</p>
  <p>the sun has gone since a while</p>
  <p>they're just starting to warm up</p>
  <p>stretch and twist. squat and drop</p>
  <p>tonight we put up quite a fight</p>
  <p>looks like the flag will not turn white</p>
  <p>each one is aiming for the heart (so much luggage in the stairs)</p>
  <p>and here we are a time apart (what if all this wasn't theirs?)</p>
