    on shuffle has elicited some eye widenings in me recently.

    <a href="https://gretchen.bandcamp.com/track/kind-words-3"
      >KIND WORDS by Gretchen</a
    >
    is a spiritual cover of
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFQJ79kuMKo"
      >Horizontal Hold by This Heat</a
    >. Everyone in that scene was <em>obviously, famously</em> inspired by This
    Heat but I hadn't heard these two songs back-to-back before to realize how
    direct it got. thanks shuffle.

    the other recent one was
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S365lLKYlf0"
      >Cadriopo by Stereolab</a
    >
    owing everything to
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IzT7qnFt1A"
      >Sun Ra's Love in Outer Space</a
    >. this one wasn't so sneaky (see also:
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FppasPSyqo8">Mellotron</a> and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Uq2VTfGbEE"
      >Ruby by Silver Apples</a
    >). i just hadn't heard Cadriopo before.

    one time I wrote a drum part for a song and was really chuffed with it and
    then listened to it some time later and realized it was basically identical
    to
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmmvZrBnQ4M"
      >Apocalypse Dreams by Tame Impala</a
    >, so y'know, not throwing shade. inspiration is sneaky too.
