    i realised recently that there are at least two ways in which we ask the
    question "is x a y?"
  </p>
  <p>
    it was when i asked "is Terminator a monster?" which is the sort of question
    i like to ask, to get into all the necessary-but-not-sufficients of dumb
    shit conceptual analysis.
    <em
      >does a monster need to be biological, or more fundamentally, not
      understood? are all monsters morally permissible to kill?</em
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    there is a tweet that responded to
    <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/VOSCIN"
      ><em>Chess Is Not A Game</em> by Deborah P. Vossen</a
    >
    that i can't find. it said something to extent of "What the author fails to
    consider is that chess is, in fact, a game." because the other way we ask
    these sorts of questions is the Family Feud way. if you surveyed one hundred
    people with "Name a monster" - zero of them would say Terminator. they would
    say Dracula or Zombie or Frankenstein. and so in that sense, Terminator is
    not a monster. it is important to be considerate of your friends and realise
    this, when asking these sorts of questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    but... y'know... if a new Terminator film came out that played with this
    idea, and used a lot of monster movie tropes, and it was a huge success,
    maybe twenty years from now a few people would think of the T-800 instead of
    Dracula.

        a classic mistake people make is believing that the groups denote
        something as real as the things themselves. This is why I‚Äôm no fun when
        people ask shit like, ‚ÄúIs a hot dog a sandwich?‚Äù I know it‚Äôs a joke
        question. But what do you people want from me? Oh, let me contemplate
        the Platonic ideal of sandwich, which definitely exists, and then get
        back to you. I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how language works. ‚ÄúSandwich‚Äù is
        a word we deploy in specific situations to effect communication; it is a
        concept we have invented in order to do things. I don‚Äôt know if a hot
        dog is a sandwich, man; what I do know is that if you asked me for a
        sandwich and I brought you a hot dog, the likelihood that you‚Äôd be
        confused or irritated is higher than it would be if I brought you a
        PB&J. Does that mean a hot dog is only 70% of a sandwich? Angels on a
        goddamn pinhead, I tell you.

    anyway. the reason i'm mentioning all this is because i just got back from a
    trip and an underappreciated way in which new places feel different is food.
  </p>
  <p>
    food is, of course, one of the top answers on the board for the Family Feud
    version of the question "Why do different countries feel different?".
  </p>

  <p>i mean supermarket food.</p>
  <p>
    yes, restaurant food in different countries is different too, but i think
    this means less when travelling in The West as i just did. every restaurant
    in my city already tries to distinguish itself with its menu and branding
    such that when taken together, they all collapse into a single category of
    "good restaurants" that is no different from any other western city's. some
    cities have
    <a href="https://www.gooddogsplantfoods.com/" target="_blank"
      >a restaurant that is uniquely good</a
    >
    that mine doesn't have, but that doesn't move the needle overall as to why
    one city will feel different. i imagine this argument breaks down when
    visiting a place with vastly different restaurant norms such as japan,
    though i have not been there, so i don't know.
  </p>
  <p>
    but as for a supermarket in a western city, i go to mine most days. i'm
    effectively doing spaced repitition on a thousand brands and products, the
    gestalt of which is a sensation of image-culture that isn't distributed
    anywhere else in the world. of course it's still all the same stuff:
    cereals, bread products, tomato sauces. what matters is that every label is
    different from the labels of the cereals, bread products, and tomato sauces
    that i've familiarised myself with over years of listing around the aisles
    of my local.

    it also contains all the food that i actually most often eat, that i will
    tend to eat less of when i'm not home.

    so if you're back from a long trip and trying to get grounded again, go to
