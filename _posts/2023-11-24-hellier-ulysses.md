a transitional species between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_(band)">women-music</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(band)">polyrhythm indie.</a> it's less than 10 minutes long and each song has an amazingly taut structure. alongside the muffled production and unexpectedly intriciate rhythm section, there are a couple of synth parts (e.g. 0:25 in <em>How to Become a Small Dead Dog</em>) that are, in my estimation, essential to its character.
