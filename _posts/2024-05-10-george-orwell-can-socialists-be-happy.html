      It is a commonplace that the Christian Heaven, as usually portrayed, would
      attract nobody. Almost all Christian writers dealing with Heaven either
      say frankly that it is indescribable or conjure up a vague picture of
      gold, precious stones, and the endless singing of hymns. This has, it is
      true, inspired some of the best poems in the world:
    </p>

    <div style="line-height: 0.5; font-style: normal">
      <p>Thy walls are of chalcedony,</p>
      <p>Thy bulwarks diamonds square,</p>
      <p>Thy gates are of right orient pearl</p>
      <p>Exceeding rich and rare!</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      But what it could not do was to describe a condition in which the ordinary
      human being actively wanted to be. Many a revivalist minister, many a
      Jesuit priest (see, for instance, the terrific sermon in James Joyce’s
      Portrait of the Artist) has frightened his congregation almost out of
      their skins with his word-pictures of Hell. But as soon as it comes to
      Heaven, there is a prompt falling-back on words like ‘ecstasy’ and
      ‘bliss’, with little attempt to say what they consist in. Perhaps the most
      vital bit of writing on this subject is the famous passage in which
      Tertullian explains that one of the chief joys of Heaven is watching the
      tortures of the damned.

    space is the place of contemporary western utopias, e.g.
    <em>Star Trek</em> or Iain M. Banks' <em>Culture</em>. All the problems back
    home have been solved. A life of luxury is freely available to anyone who
    wants it, and for those who don't: a life of exploration and diplomacy
    unencumbered by the religious and ethnic atavisms of humanity's pre-perfect
    politics. imagine a hand cracking open a cold brewski - forever.
