    (which are now on the roads in Texas.)
  </p>

  <p>They argue:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The "driver shortage" framing is industry spin on the fact that employers
      are deliberately underpaying workers to increase churn and keep the
      average pay grade low.
    </li>
    <li>
      Automation will lead to further degradation of the trucking career that
      has allowed many men to earn a decent wage and quality of life. The
      consequences of this will be dire.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Is automation necessarily anti-labour? Is it possible to automate jobs while
    protecting the people who do them?

    My supermarket installed 12 self-checkouts several years ago. In the pen,
    there's now one worker who harriedly flits between the stations, swiping
    their lanyard to authorize alcohol purchases. Repetitive and thankless.
    Pretty bad, as far as jobs go.<sup aria-labelledby="trust-bummer">1</sup>

  <p>
    I assume most of people doing this job don't love it, but that doing it is
    still one of the better options available to them. Maybe they don't have any
    skills, or the skills from a previous career aren't valued anymore. Maybe
    they like the flexibility of part-time work.<sup

  <p>
    All I know is that <em>I</em> wouldn't want that job, and that I'm grateful
    for the privileges of my life that mean it's not yet been an option I've had
    to consider - privileges that I wish were extended to everyone.

    It's all well and good for me to say that I wish for a world where everyone
    is so taken-care-of that we'd find it unconscionable to require labour that
    alienates<sup aria-labelledby="plane-flying-backwards">3</sup>, but steering
    our shambling society towards such a utopia is really hard to do. How can we
    identify and agree on <em>why</em> we have "bad jobs", align everyone's
    interests to the collective cause of reducing suffering, and correctly
    triage the opportunities we have?<sup aria-labelledby="budget-concrete"

    Maybe the answer is to read more Marx, but I don't think it's possible to
    get the Good Automation that reduces toil, without also fundamentally
    lowering the value of the equivalent human labour and therefore the power of
    those workers' strikes.
  </p>
  <p>i.e. the truckers are right to be concerned.</p>
  <p>
    But I <em>want</em> jobs to be automated. I want humans to do things other
    than scan barcodes and drive along the interstate for the majority of their
    lives. If we still have warehouses filled with humans in 15 years<sup
      aria-labelledby="piss-bottles"
      >5</sup
    >, I think that's because we've shambled wrong, even if it's because we've
    fought tooth and nail for labour.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe there's a more middle-ground Scandanavian model. Companies that
    automate must invest some additional amount in continual retraining such
    that automation remains complimentary rather than rivalrous. I'm not
    actually sure if that approach will be able to keep up with the rate at
    which human skill is outcompeted.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, I think it's going to be really hard to form a coherent story
    and set of policies to sell automation. Workers are proud of their worth,
    and are going to be skeptical that any self-sacrifice will contribute to a
    greater good, because the collectivist spirit is so dead in the West.
    Conversely, corporations will argue against paying redistributive taxes,
    because it's the profit incentive that drives the transition to full
    automation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, ultimately, I think automation will win. It's going to be hard for
    labour to globally impede technological progress, whereas tech companies
    will be able to easily relocate and improve, until they're so cost-effective
    that even the most labour-sympathetic regions will be unable to resist
    interfacing with the automated economy.

    Whether or not that irreparably tears the social contract, idk. Hope not.

        >it's an additional bummer that, even without any further automation,
        the job wouldn't have to exist if we provided for those who otherwise
        have to shoplift. in new zealand there are honesty boxes: roadside
        stations where bags of produce are left unattended with a small box to
        put money in. if a society sufficiently trusts itself, it doesn't need
        to spend money on enforcement/deterrance.
