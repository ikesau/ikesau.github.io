    In 2019, a large chandelier was installed underneath Granville Street
    Bridge, to <em>aesthetically enhance</em> the area. It was controversial
    at the time - a symbol of what's wrong with luxury condo development.<sup aria-labelledby="public-art-bylaw"">1</sup>
</p>
<p>
    I used to work near Granville Island, so when I visited Vancouver in
    early 2025, I wanted to walk around my old stomping grounds and pay the
    chandelier a visit.
</p>
<p>
    I walked to where I remembered it being installed, and discovered it had
    been removed, presumably for maintenance reasons. Disappointed, I went
    home and lamented to my sister.
</p>
<p>She replied, "Oh, it's not there anymore? By the north entrance?"</p>
<p>"By the south, you mean. And no, there's nothing."</p>
<p>
    "It was never at the south entrance. It was installed at the north
    entrance."
</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>
    I argued with my sister - who lives in Vancouver and has been to
    Granville Island countless times in the last 6 years - that she was
    wrong. I had seen that chandelier many times while working near the
    south entrance.
</p>
<p>
    After 10 minutes, she was unconvinced but sympathetic, and so we took to
    the internet, where every single article, blog, photo, or video we could
    find confirmed that the chandelier was installed and
    <em>had-only-ever-been-located</em> at the north entrance.
</p>
<p>
    I felt mad. Both ways. This was a conspiracy. I was
    <em>so</em> sure that I had seen the chandelier at the south entrance,
    and that this was all some horrible kind of gaslighting.
</p>
<p>
    But after scouring through every obscure source of evidence I could
    think of, I had nothing to back me up.
</p>
<p>Finally, reluctant and unhappy, I quietened.</p>
<p>
    I went to the north entrance a few days later. The chandelier was there.
    I looked around. I had no memory of this part of the island.
</p>
<p>
    Months have passed. I'm pretty sure what happened is that the ceiling of
    the bridge looks the same from both entrances, and I saw so many photos
    of the chandelier in the news with the familiar ceiling of the bridge
    behind it that I assumed they must have been taken from the place I knew
    where the ceiling looked like that.
</p>
<p>
    So now I have direct evidence to the contrary, and a plausible story as
    to how I got so confused in the first place. I no longer believe the
    chandelier was ever installed near the south entrance. And yet.
</p>
<p>
    I <em>still have the memory</em> of walking past it during my lunch
    break.
