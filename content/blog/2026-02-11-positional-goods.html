      Paul Bloom writes
    </a>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Scarcity generates pleasure, anxiety, and purpose. But a world that is
      post-scarcity in the sense that there is more than enough material
      resources for everyone will still have another form of scarcity—people’s
      respect, admiration, attention, desire, and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bad news about a post-scarcity utopia is that we will still be unhappy
      much of the time. The good news is that our lives will still have meaning.

    The whole essay, its citations, and comments are great. Read that first.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I should explain the qualification “So long as we remain human”. When I
      think of utopia, I’m assuming a post-scarcity world where all of our
      material needs are met, along the lines of Star Trek or Banks’s Culture
      novels.<span style="font-style: normal"

      In Bostrom’s book, he considers more extreme scenarios. We might all
      ascend to a nirvana-like state where there are no desires. We might have
      the parts of our brain that connect to suffering and boredom surgically
      ablated. Or we might all be hooked up to machines, Matrix-style, ensuring
      that our conscious existence is that of a continuous, intense orgasm
      intermixed with the feeling of total, limitless love.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this gives me the creeps myself. But, anyway, the arguments here
      apply only to utopias where human nature and human experience remain
      pretty much unchanged.

    And so this is the carve-out that makes it not-actually utopia, a kind of
    "well, when I have <em>too</em> much ice cream, I feel bad" tautology. I
    don't think he's wrong in doing this, because I too agree with Bostrom that
    utopia modelling "can serve as kind of philosophical particle accelerator,
    in which extreme conditions are created that allow us to study the
    elementary constituents of our values."<sup aria-labelledby="scotsutopia"

    It's plausible. Orwell also writes well about the contradictions of
    permanence and bliss in

    <p>
      Nearly all creators of Utopia have resembled the man who has toothache,
      and therefore thinks happiness consists in not having toothache. They
      wanted to produce a perfect society by an endless continuation of
      something that had only been valuable because it was temporary.<sup

    It depends on where you draw the lines of material versus immaterial
    scarcity in this hypothetical transitional utopia. Bloom points out the
    contradictions of sex and desire as another obstacle to our unanimous
    fulfillment, but I think more people will be happy to bunker with their

    than he would hope. OnlyFans is a billion dollar industry of ghostwriters
    tricking men. Women (the thinking gender), get yaoi visual novels.

    I think these technologies are already somewhat successfully hacking our
    social drives that undergird Bloom's critique.
