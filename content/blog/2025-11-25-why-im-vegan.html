  <p>A friend just asked me this. Might as well write it down.</p>
  <p>
    I stopped eating meat when I was 17 because my girlfriend at the time was
    vegetarian, and I knew that it was one of the remaining ways I could
    significantly lower my carbon footprint.
  </p>
  <p>
    A year or so later I made the switch to veganism because of the same logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a few years of being "outside" of meat consumption, it became possible
    for me to be able to think more critically about the moral aspects of
    breeding/farming/eating animals.<sup aria-labelledby="mental-walls">🧱</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    So now I stay vegan both to reduce emissions and habitat loss, and to try
    and absolve myself somewhat from the suffering.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cruelty and pain is greater than anyone can comprehend. It is one of the
    most evil atrocities humanity continues to commit. I desperately hope for
    its end. I want children to grow up in a world where they're truly horrified
    to learn what we did to trillions of animals for hundreds of years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Veganism is not a movement that has flattened the curve of animal suffering
    - I believe that will come from in vitro meat (<a

    - but I cannot in good conscience participate in the system in the meantime.

        People have strong mental walls about this. I have other ones about
        other systems of cruelty that I participate in. They feel just as
        considerate and justified as it used to feel to me in excluding animals
        from my circle of moral consideration. It's why I understand how
        impossible-seeming it is for most people to even entertain the idea of
        veganism.
