  <p>A friend just asked me this. Might as well write it down.</p>
  <p>
    I stopped eating meat when I was 17 because my girlfriend at the time was
    vegetarian, and I knew that it was one of the remaining ways I could
    significantly lower my carbon footprint.
  </p>
  <p>
    A year or so later I made the switch to veganism because of the same logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a few years of being "outside" of meat consumption, it became possible
    for me to be able to think more critically about the moral aspects of
    breeding/farming/eating animals.<sup aria-labelledby="mental-walls">🧱</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    So now I stay vegan both to reduce emissions and habitat loss, and to try
    and absolve myself somewhat from the suffering.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cruelty and pain is greater than anyone can comprehend. It is one of the
    most evil atrocities humanity continues to commit. I desperately hope for
    its end. I want children to grow up in a world where they're truly horrified
    to learn what we did to trillions of animals for hundreds of years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Veganism is not a movement that has flattened the curve of animal suffering
    - I believe that will come from in vitro meat (<a

    - but I cannot in good conscience participate in the system in the meantime.

        People have strong mental walls about this that can only be dismantled
        once we feel like they are no longer protecting our egos. I have other
        ones about other systems of cruelty that I participate in. They feel
        just as considerate and justified as it used to feel to me in excluding
        animals from my circle of moral consideration. It's why I understand how
        impossible-seeming it is for most people to even entertain the idea of
        veganism.
