<p>smerching is when you're looking for an emoji.</p>
<p>
  usually we smerch because we can't remember which drawer the emoji we're
  looking for is stored in (<em>is ðŸ’¦ nature or human?</em>), but sometimes also
  because we're not quite sure which pictogram best conveys the tone of what
  we're trying to express, and even less frequently because the emoji picker
  we're using isn't on the latest unicode version and isn't showing ðŸ«¨ even
  though we swear we've looked everywhere.
