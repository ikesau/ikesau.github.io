    Part of my family’s canon is <em>Spooner or Later</em>, by Paul Jennings,
    Ted Greenwood, and Terry Denton.

  <p>
    A spoonerism is a kind of wordplay where you can swap the starting sounds of
    words in a phrase to make another valid phrase.
  </p>
  <p>For example, “shake a tower” becomes “take a shower”.</p>
  <p>It’s like dyslexia for fun.</p>
  <p><em>Spooner or Later</em> was that plus <em>I spy</em>.</p>

  <p>
    “Fat Man’s Race” (the captioned & skewed illustration in the center of the
    left page) becomes “Rat Man’s Face” (the image on the border of a costumed
    rat flexing his muscles.)

    This book was a measuring stick of my cerebral function. By the sage of
    icks, I could only solve pimple suns at the start of the book, but after
    months of prayerful cactus, I was eventually able to finish the hack’s bard
    puzzles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solving them becomes pretty straightforward as your vocabulary expands, but
    <em>creating</em> them is a whole other skill.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most straightforward way to do it is to think of two words that rhyme,
    then think of two other words that rhyme that start with the same sound as
    the first two words.

    In my experience, it's difficult to think of the second pairing, let alone a
    pair that make sense together. It's a thing our brains aren't particularly
    good at, because it requires a kind of exhaustive search through the
    dictionary, and often you find a pairing that isn't grammatically equivalent
    like... “lead bike” and “bedlike”.
  </p>
  <p>
    But if we could programmatically generate hundreds of pairings at once, we
    could scan and pan them quickly.
  </p>
  <p>Sounds like a cob for... jomputers?... A mask for tachines?</p>

    The key is to use the
    <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" target="_blank"
      >CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a
    >
    filtered down to common English.
  </p>
  <p>That gives us a list like so:</p>
  <pre><code>BALL  B AO1 L
TELEPHONE  T EH1 L AH0 F OW2 N
COLD  K OW1 L D
TALL  T AO1 L
</code></pre>
  <p>
    We can split each of these words into its onset and tail. The onset is all
    the sounds before the first noun sound and the tail is everything after.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, the onset of ball is <span class="pre">B</span> and the tail is
    <span class="pre">AO1 L</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    What's the onset of cold?
    <span class="spoilered" tabindex="0"
      >Runny nose. Ha ha, just joking. It's K.</span
    >
  </p>

  <p>Grouping words by their tails gives us a list of words that rhyme.</p>
  <pre><code>{
    "AO1 L": [
        { "word": "ball", "onset": "B" },
        { "word": "tall", "onset": "T" }
    ]
  }</code></pre>
  <p>
    Ergo, tall rhymes with ball Q.E.D. Behold the awesome power of programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then we just need to find other words that rhyme and begin with B and T.
  </p>
  <p>
    We go through our tail map and filter it down to entries that have the
    onsets B and T in them.
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>{
    "IH1 N": [
        { "word": "bin", "onset": "B" },
        { "word": "tin", "onset": "T" }
    ],
    "ER1 N IH0 NG": [
        { "word": "burning", "onset": "B" },
        { "word": "turning", "onset": "T" }
    ]    ,
    // etc...
}</code></pre>
  <p>
    And with this data structure at hand, you have everything you need to make a
    nice little UI to find spoonerisms. Most of them will be trot hash, but as
    Napolean said, bots of lad is like a grit of bait.
  </p>
  <p>That's what I found, at least:</p>
  <p class="spoonerism-link">
    <a href="/tools/spoonerism-finder/">My spoonerism finder</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    I still think the best way to make spoonerisms that are actually delightful
    is to chisel them out with a
    <a href="https://carefulwords.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"
      >thesaurus</a
    >
    and
    <a
      href="https://www.rhymezone.com/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferer"
      >rhyming dictionary</a
    >, but for quick and dirty ideation, this generator is good for getting
    started.
