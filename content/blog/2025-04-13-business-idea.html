<p>"museum of thirst"</p>

<p>
  ostensibly an exhibit about the history of water and plumbing. it takes an
  hour to walk through. there are salted snacks at the start. heaters are turned
  up high. there are water fountains and vending machines throughout, but
  they're all out of order. there's a stationary bike that powers a water pump,
  but no matter how hard you pedal you're always just a bit short of getting
  water. thirst-generating pictures everywhere of sweating glasses of icy water,
  etc.
</p>

<p>
  FINALLY, when you get to the end after an hour of being thirstier than you've
  ever been in your life, there's a water bar that has every kind of water on
  tap. bliss. amazing. everyone gulps the water down feeling the most intense
  kind of relief they've ever felt...
</p>

<p>...so far. they look up and see the sign. "exhibit 2: museum of urgency"</p>
