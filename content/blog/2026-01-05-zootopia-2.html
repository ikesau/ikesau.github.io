    This movie should have been called Hisstopia because of how bad and about
    snakes it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    I remember liking the first one as an effective buddy cop conspiracy with a
    lot of worldbuilding. This one's a complete rehash, but the main character's
    emotional progress has been inexplicably reset<sup

    which makes it feel somehow both painful and pointless to see her treat her
    best friend like shit for another entire movie (the main violation is that
    she consistently disregards his opinions and ignores his requests)
  </p>
  <p>
    Things progress to the same kind of conclusion, villains are unmasked, yada
    yada. Then we get this doozy of a denouement, where Hopps the bunny and Nick
    the fox finally take the time to emotionally connect with one another:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>Nick:</strong> Okay, I don't care that we're different, y'know?
      What I care about, is you. I care about you, okay? And I didn't say it - I
      should have said it, but I didn't, because uh, well, because I am an
      emotionally insecure source of your discomfort who is not good at
      expressing his feelings. Probably because I've been on my own my whole
      life. It's not an excuse it's just, it's why instead of telling you that
      you're the best thing that ever happened me, I make jokes about your ears
      and I tell you that you try too hard when, you know, the truth is I just
      don't want you to get hurt because no one else in the world matters more
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hopps:</strong> I do try too hard because deep down I'm afraid
      that I am what everyone thinks I am. And I suppress my discomfort because
      I'm worried it makes me look weak and I want to be strong and I think of
      failing all the time. And I only take what you say personally because
      you're the only one in my life who ever believed in me, even when I don't
      even believe in myself. And I should have told you that. No one else in
      the world matters to me more than you do either.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nick:</strong> I have unresolved childhood trauma that I refuse to
      discuss because being vulnerable scares me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hopps:</strong> I make dangerous choices because I have an
      unhealthy bunny-hero complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nick:</strong> And I didn't join the ZPD because I wanted to be a
      cop. I joined because I always wanted to be part of a pack. And the
      thought of losing you scares me because... because you're my pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hopps:</strong> I should never have left you. And I do need a herd
      of therapy animals. And I should have told you that you are the only
      partner I would ever want because you're my fluffle.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Nick:</strong> Uhh..</p>
    <p><strong>Hopps:</strong> That's a bunch of rabbits.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Disney, when you write therapyspeak like this, I feel like you suck.</p>
  <p>
    Who is this for? Do we not do apologies anymore, or do we have to have a
    competition to show who's done the most Work On Themselves? Wear your friend
    down with a salvo of self-diagnoses! Manipulate them into something
    resembling forgiveness by bringing up your childhood trauma!
  </p>
  <p>
    The worst part is that she doesn't even directly acknowledge the thing that
    she did wrong! "I'm sorry that I consistently ignored your requests to take
    less risky choices. I did it because of deep, unresolved childhood earplugs
    I have." Was that so hard?
  </p>
  <p>
    I get that they're getting jokey with it - it's a comical amount of
    confession - but come on. Let's not encourage people to speak like this,
    please.
  </p>
  <p>
    Who cares. This thing made a gajillion dollars and it's for eight-year olds
    and non-poser Shakira fans. I am neither.
