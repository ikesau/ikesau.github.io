</p>

<p>
  This is an especially unflattering example of a kind of thing that can happen
  in D&amp;D.<sup aria-labelledby="creative-liberties">1</sup> The character who
  should be able to do the thing, can’t, and the character who shouldn’t, can.
  Ideally you come up with a narratively satisfying reason for this (Elsie
  actually noticed the door’s hinges were exposed, and unscrewed them) but in
  the moment, Tul fails at the thing he’s meant to be good at.
</p>

<p>
  <em
    >The duo sprint to the top of the tower, but it’s empty save for a clouded
    mirror with runes etched around its frame. Elsie scrutinizes them. She rolls
    a 7 and so recognizes that they’re written in an infernal script, but
    doesn’t know what it says. Tul gives it a go, and rolls an 18. He reckons
    it’s a portal device which the duke has used to escape from their clutches
    again.</em
  >
</p>

<p>
  How’d you figure that out, Tul? Oh, you saw an artifact like this when you
  were young? Okay, sure.
</p>

<p>
  It’s not implausible, but it sucks for Elsie. She has this whole backstory
  about how she studied for years at the Gnomish Academy, but because she’s only
  level 3, the rules say that she’ll only succeed at trying to investigate
  things 11/20ths of the time.
</p>

<p>
  It's in this way that D&amp;D is a <em>highly structured</em> fantasy
  roleplaying game. It gives its players rules to follow and a way to establish
  the probabilities of risky outcomes that make the story suspenseful.
</p>

<p>
  These rules are <em>simulationist</em>. The Player’s Handbook tells you how
  things work in the same way that the laws of physics and biology do: here’s
  how fast you can run; here’s how far a fireball can fly; here’s the number you
  need to roll higher than on a twenty-sided die to hit a far away target. If
  you don’t run to be within range of the goblin, you can’t hit them with your
  fireball, which means they’ll be able to get away. Just like real life.
</p>

<p>
  In this magical physics sandbox, memorable &amp; amazing adventures happen,
  purely through the power of your collective imaginations. It truly is amazing,
  and good D&amp;D rules.
</p>

<p>
  But bad D&amp;D can happen. Everyone has different views on what it
  constitutes, but mine are converging on the idea that a lot of it is baked
  into the fundamental design of the game.
</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>

<p>
  The first tabletop roleplaying game I ever played was Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  Fourth Edition. I was fourteen, playing over the internet with some guys from
  Texas that I knew through video games.
</p>

<p>
  Like all of our influences, Fourth Edition itself was very video gamey, but I
  fell in love with the agentic freedom it granted. Yes, we were spending most
  of the time fighting monsters and using our special abilities that did
  area-of-effect damage in tactically optimal ways, but I loved that I could
  interact with my fellow players in-character, and choose to pursue
  <em>any</em> way forward that I wanted. It was a dramatically blindered
  version of the game, but still kaleidoscopic compared to the 2-colour palette
  of any
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">video game RPG</a> I’d
  played till then.
</p>

<p><strong>Level 2</strong></p>

<p>
  Skip forward some years. That campaign had ended, a new version of D&amp;D had
  come out, and new genre of Entertainment Product had risen: Actual Play
  podcasts. These shows - <em>Critical Role</em>, <em>Harmonquest</em>,
  <em>Dimension 20</em> - brought Los Angeles creative talent to my nerdy hobby,
  and completely revolutionized what I understood the game to be. D&amp;D wasn’t
  just a way to play fractal Skyrim, but an actually-good vehicle for improvised
  comedy and story-telling.
</p>

<p>
  They did accents and voices. Their characters made choices that were
  self-sabotaging. Their instincts were informed by screenwriting, and they
  paced the game by cutting between scenes like a TV show script.<sup
    aria-labelledby="escapism-escapism"
    >2</sup
  >
</p>

<p>
  I began to realize that there was more to the game than the video
  game-mechanical success of finishing the quest and acquiring the loot. There
  was also a narrative success in discovering your character; having fun in the
  downtime scenes; Really Caring about your peers and the NPCs.
</p>

<p>
  The extent to which that had been happening to me before was incidental. A
  neat side effect of playing the real game. I’ve since realized it’s actuallly
  the principle reason I want to play, and the trouble is that a lot of
  D&amp;D’s design pulls in the opposite direction.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  As it’s commonly played, D&amp;D requires the Dungeon Master to prepare a lot
  in advance. You want to have a lot of things ready for all the contingencies
  of your players’ actions. If you have a village, who’s in it? Your players
  should be free to talk to any of them, so what are they like? What are their
  motives? If you have roads leading out of your village, where do they go? If
  there’s danger, how can it be construed to the form of an exciting combat
  encounter that the players have fair odds of surviving?
</p>

<p>
  For people who aren’t good at improvising, figuring out all of this in advance
  feels like a good way to make sure you won’t get flustered in the moment, or
  fail to come up with anything interesting for your players to do. For years, I
  actually really enjoyed doing this. Every week, I’d spend a couple of hours
  worldbuilding, or designing dungeons, or creating puzzles. It was a great
  creative outlet.
</p>

<p>
  But I think it also had a pacifying effect on the players, especially the new
  ones. The complexity of the D&amp;D’s rules already put them in a position of
  recipiency, and from there, it wasn’t a large leap to infer that the story of
  this game was also to be recieved, to be <em>experienced</em>.
</p>

<p>
  This can work okay if they’re <em>liking that experience</em>, but when I
  started my last group that didn’t jibe with my ideas as much, it started to
  feel wasteful and unsatisfying. They didn’t like my locations or NPCs. They
  didn’t bite the plot hooks I set. I don’t think they felt like the game’s
  calls to action spoke to their characters. The group lost its momentum and I
  lost my spark.
</p>

<p>
  Now, this was first and foremost a communication problem. If we’d have some
  so-called Session Zeroes to talk about what kind of game we wanted to play,
  before any dice were rolled, a lot of this disappointment could have been
  avoided. If only I’d spent half as much time working with the players to
  develop their characters and prepare things that directly tied into their
  motives as I did thinking about the political factions of my made-up city
  state!
</p>

<p>Alas.</p>

<p>
  D&amp;D doesn’t <em>have</em> to be this way, but its design and luminaries
  encourage it, and I think that’s why I made that mistake. As popularly
  performed, the Dungeon Master is the god-referee of the game. They know
  everything that isn’t the character’s thoughts, and they reveal it to the
  players with authoritative power. The reason those Actual Play shows were so
  compelling was because of all the work their DMs did. They had so many ideas.
  Their characters were so thought-through. The world felt so alive.
</p>

<p>
  I still think that’s true (Brennan Lee-Mulligan, you’re a genius), but not the
  whole truth. The reason those Actual Play shows were so compelling was because
  everyone was <em>actually compelled</em> to enthusiastically engage with the
  game, and in the case of Dimension 20, this happened because of a lot of good,
  effective, and cooperative preparation.
</p>

<p>
  So imagine my surprise when I started listening to a
  <a href="https://www.spoutlore.com/">non-D&amp;D Actual Play podcast</a> that
  was just as compelling without any of that.
</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>[DUNGEON WORLD ENTERS]</strong></p>

<p>
  Where D&amp;D uses dice to determine whether or not characters succeed in
  their attempts to do things, Dungeon World (and all games of its pedigree,
  based on a system called Powered by the Apocalypse,) use dice to determine
  <em>what the <strong>narrative</strong> outcome of an action should be</em>.
  It’s not “here’s the number you need to do this thing.” It’s “here’s the
  number you need to do this thing <em>without anything else happening</em>”. If
  you roll low, you can still succeed at whatever you were trying to do, but
  some complicating stuff will happen too.
</p>

<p>Let’s imagine the scene from the beginning with this new system:</p>

<p>
  <em
    >Tul, the fearsome barbarian, pursues the duke down one of the castle’s
    corridors. Elsie, his gnomish wizard companion trails behind, holding her
    velvet hat in place with one hand and a crumpled scrollbook with the other.
    Slam! The duke locks the door behind him, and his footsteps disappear up the
    tower. Roaring, Tul crashes his shoulder into the door, rolling a 2,
    bursting through the door in an explosion of oak splinters. With a horrible
    crash, the stone frame collapses behind him, separating him from Elsie and
    alerting the whole castle’s guard to their location</em
  >
</p>

<p>
  Tul gets to be the big tough barbarian, and yet they’ve still got problems!
</p>

<p>
  <em
    >“Go on without me!” Elsie yells. She turns to face the advancing captain of
    the guard, a ball of violet magic forming in her hand. Tul races up the
    tower, but all he finds is a mirror, clouded as if by a sulfuric smoke. “Go
    away!” Elsie incants in the language of old magic, releasing the lightning
    from her hands. She rolls a 4. The blast flies towards the guard, slows,
    reverses, and rushes back into Elsie. A brilliant flash surges up the tower
    and she feels her presence get transported. Tul opens his eyes. He sees
    Elsie in the mirror, but she’s not in the room. Her reflection mouths
    something: “Get me out of here!”</em
  >
</p>

<p>
  Isn’t that cooler? Yeah, I took more creative liberties with how magic works
  in these second examples, but that’s because I can! There’s no rigid 100-page
  chapter that spells out the mechanics of magic in Dungeon World. Magic works
  in service of the fiction, in the way you want it to, and the way I wanted it
  to work is that it can sometimes activiate powerful magical artifacts if used
  in their presence.
</p>

<p>
  The way Powered by the Apocalypse games center “narrative advancement” as the
  unitary output of players’ actions means that the rules of the game are more
  abstract, and (as written) a lot simpler<sup
    aria-labelledby="dungeon-world-RULES"
    >3</sup
  >. There’s more hand-waving, trusting the whole group to use their own
  judgement to decide whether or not the goblin’s in range for fireballing. This
  blurs the dichotomy of authority:non-authority prevalent in D&amp;D and
  empowers new players to collaborate in adjudication from the beginning.
  Moreover, the game explicitly encourages all players to add details to the
  lore of the world that they want. The DM isn’t the sole expert of the universe
  from whom its details are revealed. They’re just the person who plays the NPCs
  and adds fuel when the fire begins to dwindle, the fire that doesn’t even need
  to be roaring from the get go, because the players all build it up together.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  I really like this system. I really want to play it (specifically a more
  recent game called
  <a href="https://primarchthemage.itch.io/chasing-adventure"
    >Chasing Adventure</a
  >
  which further refines the rules).
</p>

<p>
  Will it go well? I hope so! But I can also imagine some ways it might not.
  Improvising is a skill, and I don’t have much practice at it. If all my
  players are similar, maybe we’ll have some really tepid scenes where not much
  happens. They might also not like the untethered floatiness of it. One of my
  friends likes the crunchy combat and meta-layer of D&amp;D where the players
  are trying to <em>beat</em> the DM through technically legal tactics that test
  the limits of D&amp;D’s rules. Many players enjoy min-maxing the rules and
  finding ways to be powerful, regardless of the narrative implications or
  consequences.
</p>

<p>
  On the other side, in the Spout Lore podcast, sometimes a character will ad
  lib a world detail that I don’t like. It might be kinda boorish, or in
  contradiction with some previously established lore. Presumably this happens
  even more often than the podcast implies, because they can edit out the parts
  they regret in hindsight. Nevertheless, I think this tension is a necessary
  part of the success of the game. The democratic ownership of the story means
  that concessions will be made, in service of a story that everyone cares about
  and feels a part of.
</p>

<p>
  I’m looking forward to running a one-shot with Chasing Adventure, and will
  possibly report back in the future.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  I’m not trying to make a persuasion check with this essay, despite its framing
  of my development as some sort of ascension towards truth. Narrative RPG
  systems are the devil I don’t know, and all the things I’ve kvetched are
  intrinsic to D&amp;D are <strong>a)</strong> part of the fun for many players,
  and <strong>b)</strong> completely solvable with homebrew rules.
</p>

<p>
  But I, personally, just want to fight mental and physical (and slime) demons,
  not a rules system or stock price<sup aria-labelledby="hasbro-oh-no">4</sup>
</p>

<p>So uhhh, yeah. It's... time to... roll the dice.</p>

      Normally the die rolls aren't functionally embedded into the narrative,
      but I did that here because it flowed better. Normally it goes like this:
