title: on “spiritual damage”
---

<p>in arguments, i sometimes say “this is bad because it damages our souls.”</p>
<p>
  i think i got it from
  <a href="https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/">david graeber.</a>
</p>
<p>but what does it actually mean?</p>

  it's probably easier to understand what it <em>does</em>, which is, i think,
  create a sort of rhetorically unassailable position. what are you going to
  say? nuh-uh! it <em>doesn't</em> damage our souls! are we both just going to
  assume we know exactly what the other person means by that? no.
</p>
<p>
  ime people just let it slide, probably taking it as some version of “damn,
  okay. ike <em>really</em> doesn't like this thing” but in a way that feels
  like i've managed to impress my superior sensitivity upon them. i'm a person
  who is concerned with humanity's preternatural wellbeing, and you are not, so
  surely my position is more considerate than yours.
</p>
<p>
  and what i'm realizing, that's a cheap/lazy/pointless sort of thing to do
  unless i'm willing to really elaborate on what i mean. not to say that we
  shouldn't contemplate our spirituality, just that said contemplations
  shouldn't be used flippantly as a tool of persuasion. that's bad for our
  souls.
