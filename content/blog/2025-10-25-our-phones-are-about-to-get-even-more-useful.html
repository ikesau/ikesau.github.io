title: phones are about to get more useful

<section>
  <p>
    Two years ago, a colleague asked me "concretely, what's a way in which you
    think AI is going to change the world?"
  </p>
  <p>
    I said: the way we relate to and use software. We will stop writing or
    installing it.<sup aria-labelledby="fumble-of-the-century">1</sup>
    We'll instead have an AIs that dynamically write our programs for us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two years later, I'm feeling even more confident about this. Claude Code and
    Codex are the worst they'll ever be, and they're already one-shotting simple
    webapps.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted it for months, but never got around to making it myself, because to
    code it by hand would take more time than the idea was worth. But now I can
    get it made in 30 seconds, provided I have my laptop on me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next step could be making it possible to create these apps by typing a
    prompt on my phone: "Write a program that does X, Y, and Z."
  </p>
  <p>
    The model writes it and stages it somewhere. I'd maybe ask for a few
    iterations, and once satisfied, deploy it on my site.<sup

    I think this kind of capability would be really useful, and I'm sure the
    ergonomics will improve rapidly (alongside their capabilities and possible
    complexity, incorporating our phones' cameras and gyroscopes and what have
    you.)
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, it remains a niche power among those who are somewhat technical or
    tool-making. But it seems kind of easy to commodify and market: what could
    be more useful than making it easy to make useful things?
  </p>
  <p>
    Interoperability will be important, and there will still likely need to be
    some organizational effort to design and spread standards so that my bespoke
    apps can interact with other people's bespoke apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    But, basically, we're all going to become Geordi Laforge, Chief Prompt
    Engineer, and everything will go great. There will be no problems.

      I could already make a provisional version of this by writing an API on my
      homeserver, but I could also just wait 6 more months until all the AI
      companies release their own version.
