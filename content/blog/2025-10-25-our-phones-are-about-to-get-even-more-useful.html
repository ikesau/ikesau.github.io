title: phones are about to get more useful

<section>
  <p>
    Two years ago, a colleague asked me "concretely, what's a way in which you
    think AI is going to change the world?"
  </p>
  <p>
    I said: the way we relate to and use software. We will stop writing or
    installing it.<sup aria-labelledby="fumble-of-the-century">1</sup>
    We'll instead have an AIs that dynamically write our programs for us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two years later, I'm feeling even more confident about this. Claude Code and
    Codex are the worst they'll ever be, and they're already one-shotting simple
    webapps.
  </p>
  <p>

      metronome I asked Codex to make.</a

  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted it for months, but never got around to making it myself, because to
    code it by hand would take more time than the idea was worth. But now I can
    get it made in 30 seconds, provided I have my laptop on me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next step could be making it possible to create these apps by typing a
    prompt on my phone: "Write a single-page vanilla JS web app at this URL that
    does X, Y, and Z."
  </p>
  <p>
    The model writes it and stages it somewhere. I'd maybe ask for a few
    iterations, and once satisfied, deploy it on my site.<sup

    I think this kind of capability would be really useful, and I'm sure the
    ergonomics of such a thing will improve rapidly. Also their capabilities and
    possible complexity, incorporating our phones' cameras and gyroscopes and
    what have you.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, it remains a niche power among those who are somewhat technical or
    tool-making. But it seems kind of easy to commodify and market: what could
    be more useful than making it easy to make useful things?
  </p>
  <p>
    basically, we're all going to become Geordi Laforge, Chief Prompt Engineer,
    and everything will go great. There will be no problems.

      I could already make a provisional version of this by writing an API on my
      homeserver, but I could also just wait 6 more months until all the AI
      companies release their own version.
