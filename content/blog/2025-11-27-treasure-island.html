    uploaded by (I believe) the man himself. He does a great Long John Silver

      It's wild to think how many of today's pirate tropes this popularized or
      influenced<sup aria-labelledby="the-mouse">☠️</sup> Yo ho ho and a bottle
      of rum!

      Pew was a really menacing minor villain! I was genuinely scared of him.

      Despite the mutiny, everyone has a very strong code of honour. Jim makes
      promises to the pirates and desperately hopes to keep them, to his great
      personal risk.

      They didn't know what caused malaria back then. The doctor is going on
      about the quality of the air: low, boggy air was bad. dry, mountainous air
      was good. Cool to see some proto-science.

      The novel's flooded with nautical terminology. How many of these words and
      terms did the average British kid know back then?

    I think I might be entering my audiobook era. Going for a run getting lost
    in a story is a delightful double-dip.
