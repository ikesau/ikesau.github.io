<blockquote>
  <p>
    Suppose there were aliens who were sort of sentient plants, okay? And
    they're coming to visit Earth. Earth was in their tour guide- the tour
    catalog, because Earth, they know, had rainforests and a huge uh- plant
    biodiversity. And so they just want to see what's going on here. And these
    are aliens that live off of sunlight and on their ship they just have lamps
    that they lay in, and that that's where they get their energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, they've never killed anything in their entire lives. The idea of killing
    something to survive is like completely foreign to them. So they arrive at
    Earth, and they see people who kill animals to live, but they don't really
    understand animals, okay, but they do understand plants, okay. Plants are
    their brethren.
  </p>

  <p>
    So they find another category of humans that exclusively kills plants for
    their survival. They would freak out, okay? They would say "what are you do-
    what? These are all people! They're just sitting there innocently gathering
    sunlight! They can't even run away from you! And what are you doing? You're
    hack- you're cutting them down and you're eating them? Not only that, you
    are harvesting their reproductive organs especially to be consumed. The
    flowers, the nuts, the berries, the- the- all of this!"
  </p>

  <p>
    They would just freak. And they'd continue to watch and they'd look at
    people shopping in Whole Foods and they see people in the produce aisle, as,
    as infanticide. Because what are they doing? They're specially buying baby
    carrots. Baby spinach. Baby artichokes. Baby eggplant. Bean sprouts. And so
    the most barbaric living things on Earth would be the humans who are
    harvesting plants to be eaten.
