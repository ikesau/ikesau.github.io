    When people say "the problem is education" they tend to mean "I want
    everyone to have the same beliefs as me, but persuading adults is too hard."
  </p>
  <p>
    I think it's naive to assume that agreeing on a national curriculum is any
    easier, but assuming that you could, it's even more naive to assume that
    students would internalize the lessons you want them to.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example: in high school, I didn't understand our English curriculum's
    emphasis on literary analysis essays. They seemed mysteriously tautological:
    fill in the essay template to demonstrate to the person marking you that you
    can fill in an essay template.<sup aria-labelledby="aghast-teacher">😱</sup>

    I don't mean to insist that the subject of english "justify itself" in that
    stembro way. I just don't remember anyone ever telling me why it was
    worthwhile to learn how to analyze literature. I have since read some greek
    plays and can say with confidence that this was a tragedy.
  </p>
  <p>Here's an explanation that might have worked for me:</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic; padding: 8px">
    Stories are one of the main ways we make sense of the world. Writing is
    another. We write about stories to gain an ability to think about how
    they're written and what they mean. This allows to be more persuasive and
    less susceptable to bullshit. It also allows us to share our perspectives
    with one another, which is essential for democracy.
  </p>

    I smashed that out in 2 minutes. It's arbitrary and a thousand alternate
    justifications exist, but the idea is that, for each student, there is a
    justification that could appeal to them.
  </p>
  <p>Why didn't we do this? Some ideas</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>We did</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          but not often enough to remember 10 years later (wisdom has a
          luridness problem)
        </li>
        <li>
          but I didn't like the justifications ("<em>it'll be on the test</em>",
          "<em>it's needed for jobs that pay a lot of money</em>")
        </li>
        <li>
          but it doesn't work. Existentialism doesn't vibe with kids before they
          know their spelling, or, it doesn't make a measurable difference.
          (also, if every teacher was making the best case for their subject,
          wouldn't it all come out in the wash and students would drift towards
          their natural competencies as we currently do?)
        </li>
        <li>
          but in the wrong way. Teachers mistakenly believe they
          <em>are</em> teaching purpose, simply because the purpose is so
          obvious to them that they don't realize how much more explicit
          articulation it needs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>We can't</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>it's too politically contentious to agree on</li>
        <li>
          it's too expensive to personalize per student, teachers are too busy,
          etc
        </li>
        <li>
          teachers are lacking in real-life experience to know all the potential
          applications of what the kids are learning.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>We shouldn't</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          this is something you can only figure out yourself, and it can only
          ever be an ongoing process.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    I suspect the answer is some combination of the above and more.
    <sup aria-labelledby="what-schools-do">🏫</sup> It's clearly not "no one's
    ever thought of it before", but pretending that it is, what outcomes would I
    hope for?<sup aria-labelledby="philospher-king-hubris">🌏</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    If I was motivated to write literary analysis because I cared about
    democracy, maybe my teacher or I would realize that it would then be good to
    actually try to engage with the substance of other students' arguments.
    Let's actually test if it's working! It's wild to me how little time we
    spent as a class, or in groups, debating what
    <em>V for Vendetta</em> actually meant.
  </p>
  <p>
    We never tried to persuade one another to adopt different beliefs about what
    a story was about, or whether it was good or bad. Our essays were written in
    a near vaccuum, graded more on their internal coherence than in relation to
    other people's arguments. It's astounding, really, how little dialogue there
    was. No opportunities to say "I don't think that makes sense" in response to
    someone's poorly constructed argument. No way to learn better ways of seeing
    things.<sup aria-labelledby="solipsism">🧠</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    And now we're sleepwalking into education's purpose being entirely lost with
    language models. I see students at cafés copy-pasting to and from their
    moodles and can't help but think "Damn, if only you were a little better at
    questioning what any of this is for."
  </p>
  <p>It's so parallel to the alignment problem that I'd argue it's a comedy.</p>

        it's hard to choose what to say here, because "outcomes for the world's
        education systems" is so enormous, anything I say feels like a narrow,
        arbitrary, and contingent projection of my personal values - the hubris
        of the philosopher king - nevertheless, I can think of one principle
        that feels somewhat politically agnostic: the more we can reconcile our
        desires with the actions available to us, the better. See Amartya Sen's

        it worked okay for my mathematical education, where memorizing
        algorithms could be done solipsitically, but seems an enormous waste of
        potential motivation to lobotomize the social component from my class's
        english education.<sup aria-labelledby="and-now-look-at-me">🤺</sup>
