      No matter how hard they try, brain scientists and cognitive psychologists
      will never find a copy of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony in the brain – or
      copies of words, pictures, grammatical rules or any other kinds of
      environmental stimuli. The human brain isn’t really empty, of course. But
      it does not contain most of the things people think it does – not even
      simple things such as ‘memories’.

      What would it even mean to "find" Beethoven's 5th in the brain?<sup

      At best, you could take a perfectly precise measurement of someone's brain
      state and use that data to reconstruct their memory of the music. (In the
      way that scientists are

      the evolution of metaphors for the brain (clay → hydraulics → machines →
      electrochemistry) traces a series of practical but incomplete models:
      other paradigms, with their own

      >, which allowed us to iteratively complexify our conceptual model of the
      brain<sup aria-labelledby="brainhard">🧠</sup>.

      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      it's not a bad thing to have an incomplete paradigm. it's a bad thing once
      it supresses a better, more explanatory one from coming along. Robert
      suggests that this is what the humours metaphor did, though I think there
      were probably many more significant factors at play if you want to talk
      about why it took so long for the renaissance to happen.
    </li>
    <li>
      there's a type of computer process that people colloquially refer to as
      "baking." the computer isn't literally putting bits in an oven at 180°C,
      but the metaphor is helpful because it quickly conveys that some
      ingredients were assembled, and now a process is about to occur that will
      take some time, and there will be some output on the other side that we
      care about. language is full of these and we have to make subjective calls
      about which metaphors are best at capturing the dynamics of a system that
      are relevant to us based on how well we think they strike the right
      balance between clarity, correctness, intuitiveness, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      it's not clear to me that the information processing metaphor is stunting
      us. on the contrary,

        >artificial neural networks are allowing us to interpret the brain more

      materialist theories of cognitive science are giving us actually
      falsifiable theories of consciousness.

    <li>
      his example of a "non-algorithmic" explanation of how to catch a ball is
      literally an algorithm. I think we have fundamentally different
      understandings of what "information", "processing", and "computation"
      means.
    </li>
    <li>
      his "metaphor-free" everything-is-operant-conditioning proposal is a
      theory that collapsed in the 70s?

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Misleading headlines notwithstanding, no one really has the slightest idea
      how the brain changes after we have learned to sing a song or recite a
      poem. But neither the song nor the poem has been ‘stored’ in it. The brain
      has simply changed in an orderly way that now allows us to sing the song
      or recite the poem under certain conditions. When called on to perform,
      neither the song nor the poem is in any sense ‘retrieved’ from anywhere in
      the brain, any more than my finger movements are ‘retrieved’ when I tap my
      finger on my desk. We simply sing or recite – no retrieval necessary.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Why don't we just say that that's retrieval, which is maybe kind of similar
    to other sorts of things that we call retrieval, and see if this helps us
    explain or make predictions about a system any better than before? "The
    brain doesn't retrieve. We simply sing." is not a predictive theory that
    could help us understand things, rather it suggests that we shouldn't even
    try.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't think this was a good representation of anti-representationalism,
    and I don't claim to have any answers as to how the brain works (I'm just a
    guy who really liked
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_You%3A_A_New_Science_of_Consciousness"
      >Being You</a
    >) but I think if you're going to point out why the dominant paradigm
    doesn't work, you need to make a better case than this.
