<p>
  in a bastardized interpretation of
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >fitness landscapes</a
  >, i've recently been thinking about how every decision i make is a step in
  some direction in an infinite mountain range. in this space, my altitude isn't
  environmental fitness. it's something more like "personal value" or "amount
  self-actualized" where you can imagine standing at the peak of a hill in this
  endless mountain range as being highly satisfied with myself, highly engaged
  in my life.
</p>
<p>
  some steps are uphill and take more effort. some steps are downhill and take
  less. sometimes it's necessary to take a step downhill to conserve energy, or
  to get to a different path on the mountain. but too many steps down and
  motherfucker, you're in a depression.

<p>
  watching youtube is almost always a step downhill. that in and of itself isn't
  a bad thing - i really do think youtube is one of this century's triumphs -
  the issue is how easily youtube turns a single step into a scree run. i've had
  nights of binging youtube so bad that my eyes ached, and then instead of
  stopping, i continued to watch just with one eye open at a time. deranged.

  but captivating people is youtube's job. the effectiveness of its
  recommendation algorithm is what determines the size of the pie that it
  divvies up and dishes out to an ecosystem of hundreds of thousands of content
  creators. better recommendations = more time on youtube = more advertisements
  watched = more money to go around. at no point will any of this system's
  structural incentives prompt someone to say "you know what? i think youtube's
  recommendations are too good. let's degrade them a little"<sup

  so if youtube's addictive and unlikely to change, and i will always like to
  occasionally watch things on it, what is to be done?
</p>
<p>block recommendations.</p>

  install

  this will hide the sidebar and the thumbnails that show up at the end of the
  video: the website equivalent of moving the bowl of M&Ms that you have in your
  kitchen to a jar in the cupboard. i've been doing this for a week and the
  difference is extremely noticeable. i still check out my subscriptions each
  day and watch videos there that catch my eye, but afterwards, i just close the
  tab.<sup aria-labelledby="no-hooks">2</sup>

<p>
  stupor evaded, i can consider an option that might take me uphill. write,
  read, play music, reply to that message, go for a walk, meditate, just
  generally cultivate some fuckin' eudaimonia.
</p>
<p>
  the nice thing about this is that i can also turn it off when i want. some
  integral parts of my personal development were catalysed by a youtube video i
  discovered hours deep in a binge, many songs i love i first heard on random
  youtube mixtapes. i can still make the time for that and switch off the
  filters temporarily, it just turns it into a conscious decision, not something
  that happens through my focus being sapped in the middle of something else, a
  process that is slowly turning us into a herd of mediocre dilettantes.

  is this just an ornate elaboration of "no pain, no gain" ? yes. have a million
  people already written about how
  <em>web 2.0 makes us unhappy, actually</em> ? yes. is this cow thing i've got
  going on with the pictures ridiculous,

    >romantic, and self-pitying</a

  ? yes
</p>
<p>
  doesn't matter. if you suspect you might be watching too much youtube to get
  up the mountain, this is my recommendation.
