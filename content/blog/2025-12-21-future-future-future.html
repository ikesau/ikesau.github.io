  <p>One of my friends just sent me a voice note making a couple of points:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Visual generative AI is getting really good</li>
    <li>
      This is starting to do weird things on our video and image-based social
      media networks
    </li>
    <li>
      Influencers are nervously wondering if their industry will survive when
      brands can have individualized, hot & funny digital avatars market
      products to consumers directly
    </li>
    <li>
      Maybe we shouldn't be posting photos of ourselves online if they can be
      used by bad guys to make deepfakes of us?
    </li>
    <li>
      Awareness of all of this is a privilege: less-informed people will be
      exploited by these systems that they don't understand
    </li>
  </ol>
  <img src="/images/squidward-future-cheese.png" height="280" width="421" />

  <p>
    I basically agree with all of that, though I'm very uncertain as to what the
    end state of any of it is.<sup aria-labelledby="forecasting">🌦️</sup>

    Governments are trying to clamp down on unfettered internet access:
    age-restricting websites, banning social media for teens. Maybe this leads
    to the beginning of a utopian society-wide detox from the internet:

        At the end of such a day [of no phones] in France, my students weren’t
        pining for two hours on Instagram. If I’d handed them all devices at 6
        every night, I’d have witnessed a lot of rotting. Here’s what happened
        instead: Ping-Pong, knitting, charades, climbing hay bales, letter
        writing, stargazing, sitting through two-hour dinners with nary a device
        on the table. Between bursts of writing, my students actually rested.
        Like the kids that they still are, they played.
      </p>

      <p>
        After four weeks of these new rhythms, my students were raving to me
        about the effects: Will was sleeping more deeply than ever before, Gaby
        was reading quickly again, Devin had shocked himself not only by his
        output (15 essays in four weeks) but also by how long (a full six hours)
        he could just sit in a room — alone — and write.

          No one, besides maybe Neil Postman, could have predicted the formation
          of an international pornography cult. But the gooners’ rise does, in
          retrospect, possess a certain inevitability. Anyone paying attention
          to online porn’s evolution over the preceding twenty years could
          sense, in its brain-melting variety and abundance, the blueprint for a
          new kind of person, a new relationship to human sexuality. In my own
          lifetime, I have seen incredible advances in the world of pornography.
          When I was a boy, there were still porn magazines; fathers hid them on
          high shelves. You stood on stools and gawked at them in a state of
          mortal terror. But by the time I started college, in the late Aughts,
          the foundations of our present porn environment were firmly
          established. Widespread broadband internet had enabled the rise of the
          so-called tube sites: platforms like Pornhub, which streamed untold
          numbers of clips free of charge. Then came the smartphones,
          transforming every toilet stall into a potential porn theater. The
          very air, suddenly, was misted with pornography.

          The problem is not just porn sites. They are of course a massive
          concern. Kids as young as nine are addicted. The average age to
          discover porn is now 13, for boys and girls. And many in my generation
          are now realising just how much being raised on porn affected them,
          believing it “destroyed their brain” and distorted their view of sex.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the problem is bigger than that. Porn is everywhere now. TikTok is
          serving up sex videos to minors and promoting sites like OnlyFans. The
          gaming platform Twitch is exposing kids to explicit live-streams. Ads
          for “AI sex workers” are all over Instagram, some featuring kids’ TV
          characters like SpongeBob and the Cookie Monster. And there’s also
          this sort of “soft-porn” now that pervades everything. Pretty much
          every category of content that kids could stumble across, from beauty
          trends to TikTok dances to fitness pages, is now pornified or
          sexualised in some way for clicks.

    I don't think my efforts to unzuck myself will show up in any historian's
    account of the 21st century.
  </p>
  <p>
    But locally, I think it makes a difference. All I really want to do is read
    and write and interact with my close friends. I have no desire to grow a
    following, or build a network, or develop my personal brand.

    >, but these networks are still juvenile and the federated interoperative
    dream is still on its way. Most people still don't really get what Mastodon
    is and won't know how to follow you from the walled garden they're held
    captive in. "The internet" is just five websites that all look the same. It
    asking an arm and a leg of someone to not use Facebook Messenger or to
    follow your travel updates via RSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I'm okay with doing that because I also believe that being on those
    platforms myself is just bad for me. It's like, yeah, if you want to hang
    out you have to come jogging with me, but we should all jog more and jogging
    alone is still better than nothing at all.

    On my friend's point that "technology is unfair", yeah, it sucks. I get so
    mad whenever I help my mum with some tech thing and I see how confusing the
    experience is for her. Windows has changed for the umpteenth time, and half
    of her google search results are ads or spam, and her apps don't work
    anymore because her laptop is 5 years old.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of these things has a specific fix that I can implement, but I'm
    annoyed that I have to do it at all, and like the unzucking, it's not a
    systemic fix. There are billions of people out there without a tech support
    family member.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing I'm a little optimistic about is that language model assistants
    are probably going to help most people be safer on average. There will be
    accidents and exploits and prompt injections and all the bad things, but a
    world where the majority of people ask claude "Hey Claude, is this legit?"
    before doing something they're uncertain about probably has fewer
    life-ruining errors in it. Depending on how life-ruining you think it is to
    lose the ability to think for yourself.

      of the worst aspects of revenge porn and deepfaking are the social ones -
      messages from random people making threats of sexual violence; the loss of
      control and recourse if someone decides to victimize you in this way (A
      legal framework to handle revenge porn is being implemented, at least!).
      On the other hand, the ease of access to this technology will surely numb
      us to the controversy of a naked picture of someone existing. The default
      assumption will be "it's fake" if you see footage of someone naked, in the

      that funny with Mastodon. Most instances are very anti-AI, but they're
      also posting their manifestos on the most scraping-friendly social media
      platform there is. Their response is "yeah, but AI companies should
