title: simulation fibrosis

<p>
  I was listening to a podcast the other night where one of the hosts
  complimented Tim Urban on his knack for defining conceptual structures that
  help clarify a confused subject. Unfortunately, the given example was Tim
  adding Up-Down to the Left-Right political spectrum, where "up" is being
  educated and rational, and "down" is being primitive and emotional.

<p>
  As far as poltical compass memes go... pretty bad.<sup

<p>Still. Love a good model.</p>
<p>
  Here's one I've been thinking about recently: in fiction, there's a tension
  between maintaining the consistency of the universe's rules, and having the
  flexibility to create suspenseful drama. Call it the Simulation-Drama axis.
</p>
<p>
  <strong style="font-weight: 500">
    A fictional work high in Simulation is Band of Brothers - a TV series about
    World War II.</strong

</p>
<p>
  <strong style="font-weight: 500"
    >A fictional work high in Drama is Dragon Ball Z - an anime about alien
    warriors battling one another with magic.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  Band of Brothers is tightly constrained by its commitment to historical
  accuracy. It's based on real events, which were highly documented, and highly
  familiar to its audience of war history buffs. Dragon Ball Z has its own
  constraints, but there's no objective truth like the laws of physics or
  diaries of soldiers forcing the writers to keep any of their promises. If the
  plot needs it, a character can come back from the dead, or do a special move
  that previously only one of the other characters could do. You could argue
  this dynamic is even the central promise of the show: watch DBZ to see our
  characters do unbelievable things and defy expectations over and over!<sup
    aria-labelledby="plot-nihilism"

</p>
<p>
  Dragon Ball Z gets away with it because people aren't watching it to see an
  accurate portrayal of a Saiyan invasion of earth. They watch it to see good
  guy Goku triumph over evil, understanding that it unambiguously occupies the
  Drama end of the axis.
</p>
<p>Shows get into trouble when they exist more fluidly in the middle.</p>
<p>Take Star Trek.</p>
<p>
  Is Star Trek a speculative stab at humanity's best future? A stage on which to
  perform 21st century morality plays? Trick question, <em>petaQ</em>! It's
  both, but its writers over the last 60 years have all had different ideas on
  what the exact split is.
</p>
<p>
  This is hard to swallow if you're into the show for the Simulation: shown in
  one episode that a technology works one way (which is why the episode's
  obstacle is difficult to deal with) then shown in the next that it works
  differently, because it would otherwise be inconvenient to the story that the
  writers want to tell.<sup aria-labelledby="geordi-one-off">5</sup>
</p>
<p>
  Shields are the worst for this. Sometimes a ship can withstand multiple ships'
  attacks, giving the crew time to formulate a plan and cleverly escape danger.
  Sometimes they take a single shot and need to immediately surrender. There's
  no consistent and satisfying explanation for why this is, leaving the audience
  to invent their own reasons. In severe cases, this can stretch the imagination
  so much that it rips: fans admit that it happened because the writers needed
  it to, and simulation fibrosis sets in. The characters become a little less
  relatable, the lessons a little less legitimate.
</p>
<p>
  Because how imitable are the crew's decisions if their risk calculus is
  completely random? Is it even possible to strive to be like someone who is
  only alive because of plot armour? If Star Trek says we should have
  principles, then I think the right way to argue this is by showing characters
  who exhibit these ideals navigating difficult situations and succeeding
  because of them. The self-defeating way is by showing us that these ideals are
  only viable in a world that doesn't have real consequences.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe this axis isn't useful. You could argue there are dozens of other,
  better binaries to grade our fiction on. You could <em>definitely</em> argue
  that nitpicking dumb plot holes in Star Trek is as much a part of the
  tradition as techno-babble, and that I'm taking this way too seriously. And,
  yeah, sure, but I really, <em>really</em> like Star Trek and it disappoints me
  when an episode fell short of greatness because the writers couldn't manage to
  tell a story without cheating themselves.
</p>
<p>
  I don't think it's easy to fix this, but one not-actually-practicable idea I
  had would be to create a computer game that simulated a galaxy with Star
  Trekkish rules, play it for a while, and then write your show based on
  developments that actually happened in the game. That way you're pre-committed
  to a consistent, high level set of rules, but you've still got a lot of
  freedom to work out the details.<sup aria-labelledby="kruggsmash">7</sup>
</p>
<p>
  I say not-actually-practicable because I don't think any high budget TV
  production would want to bind itself so tightly to such a gimmick, but maybe
  it's the sort of thing that we'll be able to experiment with more as
  generative AI brings the costs of animation down.

  but earnest and with warp drive. Or maybe we'll be able to bend existing
  scripts with our own events and reanimate them to tell ourselves the stories
  we want to be told.
</p>
<p>There's a poetic kind of irony to that. It'll probably happen.</p>

      >Factor analysis is a useful tool to identify the essence of what makes
      things different. When someone is described as "interested in other
      people; softhearted; good at reassurring others" - are three different
      things being described? Or are these just facets of the same One Thing?
      Hans Eysenck would argue, having analyzed the correlations between
      thousands of such statements, that they are describing one thing:
      agreeableness.<sup aria-labelledby="big-five">2</sup>

      I feel obligated to point out that this is different to making your
      Realistic Universe television compatible. e.g. the fact that Star Trek's
      zoom calls are hilariously unreliable. I've lost count of the number of
      distress beacons I've witnessed where critical information wasn't
      transmitted because the video and audio feeds are cutting out like a TV
      with a dodgy antenna. Janeway never suggets "hold on, you're frozen. can
      you just email it to me?" even though, given how frequently this problem
      occurs, spacefaring societies would almost certainly develop backup
      systems for such cases. It is necessary, for the plot, for the crew to
      have imperfect information. A garbled SOS is an easy way to set this up,
      and so functionally you'd be in the exact same predicament if you instead
      garbled the text, except the audience would have to read. Yuck!</span
