  on shuffle has elicited some eye-widenings in me recently. tracks where the
  lineage is so obvious that it's&hellip; surprising they even changed the
  title. a sneaky spiritual cover.

  <a href="https://gretchen.bandcamp.com/track/kind-words-3"
    >KIND WORDS by Gretchen</a
  >
  is one, of
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFQJ79kuMKo"
    >Horizontal Hold by This Heat</a
  >. Everyone in that Calgary scene was <em>obviously, famously</em> inspired by
  This Heat but I hadn't heard these two songs back-to-back before to realize
  how direct it got. thanks shuffle.

  the other was
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S365lLKYlf0"
    >Cadriopo by Stereolab</a
  >
  owing everything to
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IzT7qnFt1A"
    >Sun Ra's Love in Outer Space</a
  >. this one wasn't so sneaky (see also:
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FppasPSyqo8">Mellotron</a> and
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Uq2VTfGbEE">Ruby by Silver Apples</a
  >). i just hadn't heard Cadriopo before.

  one time I wrote a drum part for a song and was really chuffed with it and
  then listened to it some time later and realized it was basically identical to
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmmvZrBnQ4M"
    >Apocalypse Dreams by Tame Impala</a
  >, so y'know, not throwing shade. inspiration is sneaky too.
