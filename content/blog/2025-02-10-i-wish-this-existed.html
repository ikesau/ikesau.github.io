  a magic the gathering engine + evolution algorithm to develop and playtest
  duel decks that were perfectly balanced, variable, and fun.
</p>
<p>
  i don't want to spend my time reading through all the cards and playtesting
  with myself before
  <a href="/blog/modern-five-colour-pirates.html"
    >printing some new decks to play with my friends</a
  >, and i don't want to use online decklists because they're typically too
  competitive (filled with 4x of the best cards) and repetitive to play.

  as i understand it, this would be very hard to make. writing an engine for mtg
  is very, very complicated, and writing an AI that could play it would possibly
  be even harder (especially if you wanted to adjust its intelligence to
  simulate professional versus kitchen table play)
</p>
<p>
  but assuming that the cost of programming R&D is going to fall off a cliff,
  maybe it will be possible in the future. i would love to see it (and more
  generally, auto-balancing in all games) happen!
