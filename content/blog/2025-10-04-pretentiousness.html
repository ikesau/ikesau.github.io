    this isn't merriam-webster, but i reckon it's when you're motivated by
    something other than what you should be.

  <p>
    say you come out of the cinema with your friends and you start raving about
    how many of the shots were inspired by some french new wave guy.
  </p>

  <p>
    maybe you're authentically stoked about the cinematography (the pretense),
    but maybe you mostly just want to sound smart about movies because of how it
    affects your status in the group.

    someone who loves film for its own sake should be happy to talk about the
    film at any level with their friends. people aren't familiar with godard?
    that's okay, you could also talk about the acting or the story. if you're
    incapable of meeting people where they're at, i think people will be
    rightfully suspicious that you've got an ulterior motive.

    sometimes accusations of pretentiousness are just anti-intellectual. i've
    been called pretentious for referencing the history of a genre of music as
    part of my appreciation for a song. it felt genuine to me at the time, and i
    wish the person who said that had just said "i don't know enough about that
    to engage in the same way and i don't want to hear a lecture." or "yeah... i
    liked a different aspect of it." instead it was basically like "shut up,
    nerd."
  </p>

    it takes two. one to notice that their passion is alienating their
    interlocutor and one to engage supportively if someone seems excited to talk
    about a subject they love.
  </p>

    this stuff all gets worse if you're talking about disliking something. if
    someone's perfomatively liking something, it's easier to overlook that it's
    pretend. if they're being a hater, it's a bad deal: being persuaded to enjoy
    something <em>less</em> in order to feel insecure about my inferior
    taste.<sup aria-labelledby="enjoying-skill-issues">1</sup>

    pretentiousness doesn't have to be about taste or aesthetics. i was
    pretentious the other day when i got in a little back-and-forth with my
    driving theory instructor about whether or not he had explained something
    correctly. ostensibly i was speaking up to clarify for myself and my fellow
    students, but once he began to double-down on his confusing explanation and
    i started to try to explain to him why it was confusing, i could feel my
    motivation shift to something else: i wanted to outdo him and show that i
    was smart to the group.<sup aria-labelledby="winning">2</sup>

    it's hard to know what the exact mix of any of our motivations is. i like to
    flex my vocabulary in a way that is a little pretentious, but i also
    genuinely enjoy finding the word that feels like it perfectly conveys what
    i'm trying to say. having multiple motivations isn't necessarily
    pretentious, but you should try to reduce the amount you decieve yourself or
    others as to what they are.

        >negativity is a bad default. i think it's good to criticize things and
        be honest when you didn't enjoy something, but enjoying things is a
        skill and you should spend most of your time in the practice of
        it.</span
