<p>the other day i had some fun with poetic justice's less serious cousin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an evil man from new york</p>
  <p>once stole a shipment of chalk</p>
  <p>he was eventually busted</p>
  <p>one could say done and dusted</p>
  <p>when the cops caught him on the sidewalk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a fraudulent author from wales</p>
  <p>faked sales with no paper trail</p>
  <p>she was eventually booked</p>
  <p>when the law had a look</p>
  <p>at her very incriminating email</p>
</blockquote>
