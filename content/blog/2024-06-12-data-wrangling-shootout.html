<p>Say I have a CSV with two columns:</p>

<pre class="snippet">
country, users
China, 113
Nicaragua, 29
Jordan, 89
</pre>

<p>
  and I want to aggregate these by continent. What's an easy way to do that?
</p>

<p>
  Well I found this
  <a
    href="https://github.com/samayo/country-json/blob/master/src/country-by-continent.json"
    >country-by-continent</a
  >
  dataset by <a href="https://github.com/samayo">samayo</a>:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
[
  {
    "Country": "Afghanistan",
    "Continent": "Asia"
  },
  {
    "Country": "Albania",
    "Continent": "Europe"
  }
</pre>

<p>
  So I have everything I need except for a workflow. Let's evaluate some
  options.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#option-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a></li>
  <li><a href="#option-nushell">nushell</a></li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#option-nushell-with-polars">nushell with polars</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li><a href="#option-duckdb">DuckDB</a></li>
  <li><a href="#option-observable">Observable</a></li>
  <li><a href="#option-typescript">TypeScript with Bun</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="option-chatgpt">ChatGPT</h2>
<p>
  I attached the two files and submitted the following prompt to ChatGPT 4o:
</p>

<blockquote class="chat-from-me">
  <p>
    I have a CSV of users from each country, and a JSON file that shows which
    continent each country belongs to.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would like to aggregate my users by continent, so that I can see how many
    users I have in total from North America, Europe, etc.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It started working on the problem immediately:</p>

<blockquote class="chat-from-gpt">
  <pre class="snippet">
import pandas as pd

users_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/users.csv')
continent_data = pd.read_json('/mnt/data/cbc.json')
</pre
  >

  <p>
    To aggregate the users by continent, I'll merge the users dataframe with the
    continent data based on the country and then group by the continent to get
    the total users for each continent.
  </p>
  <p>Here is the plan:</p>
  <p>Merge the users_df with continent_data on the country.</p>
  <p>Group the merged data by the continent.</p>
  <p>Aggregate the user counts.</p>
  <p>Let's execute this.</p>

  <pre class="snippet">
merged_df = users_df.merge(
  continent_data,
  left_on='Country',
  right_on='country',
  how='left'
)

aggregated_users_by_continent = merged_df
  .groupby('continent')['Users']
  .sum()
  .reset_index()

import ace_tools as tools;
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(
  name="Aggregated Users by Continent",
  dataframe=aggregated_users_by_continent
)
</pre
  >
</blockquote>

<h3>Result</h3>

<pre class="snippet">
continent,Users
Africa,23940
Antarctica,833
Asia,18976
Europe,22472
America,13256
Oceania,10539
South America,5300
</pre>

<p>
  So, if these values are correct, I'm almost certain there won't be an easier
  or more convenient workflow.
</p>

<p>
  But that "if" is very ominous to me. How will I be able to verify its
  correctness once I've deskilled myself by outsourcing all of my
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk"
    >Human Intelligence Tasks?</a
  >
</p>

<h2 id="option-nushell">nushell</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.nushell.sh/">nushell</a> is a shell environment that
  converts all stdout into structured data that can then be piped much more
  consistently like a functional programming language.
</p>

<pre class="snippet">

╰───┴───────────────────────────────────────────╯
</pre>

<p>
  I love it. It balances accessibility with extensibility in a way that inspires
  me to understand information. I make fewer assumptions about data now that
  nushell makes it easy (and fun!) to examine things rigourously.
</p>

<p>
  How does it handle an aggregation though? First I need to load the two tables:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
let $c = nopen<sup aria-labelledby="nopen">1</sup> country-by-continent.json
let $u = nopen users.csv
</pre>

<p>these now exist in my session's scope:</p>

<pre class="snippet">
$c
╭─────┬─────────────────────┬───────────────╮
│   # │      country        │   continent   │
├─────┼─────────────────────┼───────────────┤
│   0 │ Afghanistan         │ Asia          │
│   1 │ Albania             │ Europe        │
│   2 │ Algeria             │ Africa        │
</pre>

<p>
  Now we can join them on Country-country<sup aria-labelledby="annoying-join"
    >2</sup
  >
  and group them:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
$u
| join --left $c Country country
| group-by --to-table continent
| each<sup aria-labelledby='nushell-each'>3</sup> {
  <span>insert sum</span><sup aria-labelledby='nushell-insert-sum'>4</sup> {
    <span>get items.Users | math sum</span><sup aria-labelledby='nushell-math-sum-closure'>5</sup>
  }
  | <span>select group sum</span><sup aria-labelledby='nushell-select-group-sum'>6</sup>
}
</pre>

<h3>Result</h3>

<pre class="snippet">
╭───┬───────────────┬───────╮

<p>
  Okay, not bad. Working out how to sum nested values after grouping them took
  <em>ages</em> - a lot of <code>describe</code> and reading the docs on which
  data types are compatible with which functions.<sup
    aria-labelledby="nushell-error-messages"
    >7</sup
  >
</p>

<p>
  I think with a bit more practice, I would get a lot faster at writing the
  pipes correctly, but I'm not a huge fan of polluting my shell history with
  dozens of failed attempts in the meantime, and editing commands in the
  terminal is a pain.
</p>

<h2 id="option-nushell-with-polars">nushell with polars</h2>

<p>
  It's worth mentioning that nushell also has a
  <a
    href="https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2024-04-30-nushell_0_93_0.html#introduction-of-the-polars-plugin-toc"
    >polars plugin</a
  >
  which feels like a great tool for the job.<sup
    aria-labelledby="nushell-polars"
    >8</sup
  >
  This is a popular usecase for dataframes so finding the correct syntax was
  simple.
</p>

<pre class="snippet">

<p>
  Aha! I was wondering if any of these methods would show the cases where we
  can't map the country to a continent - presumably that's what that 19175 is -
  despite the left join in the vanilla nushell method, it didn't catch this
  issue.
</p>

<p>
  So while we're here, let's see if we can list which countries aren't being
  mapped. I don't think we need a dataframe for this.
</p>

  There are some very populous countries here! This is exactly the sort of
  problem with relying on ChatGPT: your ability to trust it depends on your
  ability to verify it, which is only developed through experience.

<h2 id="option-duckdb">DuckDB</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> is a portable SQL database client.
  You can run it as a transient SQL session, or use it as an engine to run SQL
  scripts. I went with the latter because I prefer to write SQL in a text
  editor.
</p>

<p>
  Here's my <code>scratch.sql</code> file leveraging some cool DuckDB magic that
  can work with inline references to CSV and JSON files, which I can run with
  <code>cat scratch.sql | duckdb</code
  ><sup aria-labelledby="nushell-piping">10</sup>
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
SELECT
    SUM(u.Users),
    c.continent
FROM
    'users.csv' u
    LEFT JOIN 'country-by-continent.json' c
    ON u.Country = c.country
GROUP BY
    c.continent;
</pre>

<h3>Result</h3>

<pre class="snippet">

<p>
  This is about as easy as it can get, and I like that it's basically just plain
  SQL, which is never a waste of time to practise.
</p>

<h2 id="option-observable">Observable</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://observablehq.com">Observable</a> is a JavaScript notebook
  platform with a host of features for interatively visualizing and sharing
  data. There are a dozen ways I could do this aggregation with Observable,
  including creating whole databases, but I'm going to go with the most
  straightforward: attaching files and writing some code.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://observablehq.com/@ikesau/data-join-test"
    >Here's a link to the notebook.</a
  >
</p>

<p>The gist of the workflow was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Upload the files to the notebook</li>
  <li>Merge them with JavaScript</li>
  <li>
    Use Observable's SQL cell to write an aggregating SQL query on the merged
    data
  </li>
  <li>Visualize the aggregated data (an optional nicety)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Result</h3>

<img
  width="650"
  height="233"
  src="/images/observable-data-join-test.webp"
  alt="a screen cap of an Observable Table cell, showing the results of the following SQL statement: SELECT continent, SUM(Users) AS sum FROM 'join' GROUP BY continent;"
/>

<p>
  Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, Observable's SQL cell doesn't allow you
  to query from two tables at once<sup
    aria-labelledby="observable-db-limitation"
    >11</sup
  >, so either you have to join your tables before you upload them, or join them
  with JavaScript and query that third object.
</p>

<p>
  It's all quite a lot of process for answering simple questions, but it makes
  sharing your findings (and visualizing them) incredibly easy. Simon Wilson
  (the creator of <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette</a>) uses notebooks
  all the time to create
  <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw">quick, low-friction tools</a>.
  While I might not reach for them for the next question as simple as this, I
  really like Observable as a platform and I hope they're able to keep doing
  what they're doing.
</p>

<p>
  At this point, the only reason I'd consider reaching for another tool is to
  keep it local and/or to have Copilot support.
</p>

<h2 id="option-typescript">TypeScript with Bun</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> allows me to run a TypeScript REPL
  incredibly quickly. All I have to do is create an `index.ts` file somewhere.
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
bun run --watch index.ts
</pre>

<p>
  Now in my Copilot-supporting text editor of choice I can write up a quick
  script in TypeScript.
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
import fs from "fs/promises"
import { parse } from "csv-parse"

async function main() {
  const csv: { Country: string; Users: string }[] = await fs
    .readFile("users.csv", "utf-8")
    .then((data) => parse(data, { columns: true, cast: true }).toArray());

  const json = await fs
    .readFile("country-by-continent.json", "utf-8")
    .then(JSON.parse)
    .then((countries: { country: string; continent: string }[]) =>
      countries.reduce((acc, country) => {
        acc[country.country] = country.continent;
        return acc;
      }, {} as { [country: string]: string })
    );

  const byContinent = csv.reduce((acc, { Country, Users }) => {
    const continent = json[Country];
    acc[continent] = (acc[continent] || 0) + parseInt(Users);
    return acc;
  }, {} as Record&gt;string, number&lt;);

  console.log("byContinent", byContinent);
}

main();
</pre>

<h3>Result</h3>

<pre class="snippet">
byContinent {
  "North America": 13256,
  Europe: 22472,
  Asia: 18976,
  Oceania: 10539,
  Africa: 23940,
  "South America": 5300,
  unknown: 19175,
  Antarctica: 833
}
</pre>

<p>
  I thought this option was going to be more pleasant! Even with Copilot, a code
  editor, and a CSV parsing library, manually implementing a grouping algorithm
  is a chore.
</p>
<p>
  Still. When I need a REPL to test code with, using bun this way is very good.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  I think DuckDB wins? Each technique has its strengths, but writing SQL with
  Copilot, with automatic JSON/CSV handling is about as practical and quick as
  it gets.
