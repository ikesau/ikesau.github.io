title: superman (2025)

<section>
  <p>
    i saw superman yesterday. the plot is that
    <span class="spoilers" tabindex="0">lex luthor is up to no good.</span>
  </p>
  <p>(there will be uncensored spoilers throughout the rest of this thing.)</p>
  <p>
    the film has a lot of funny movie logic, but basically does what it needs to
    do. i liked how perfunctorily the monsters of the week were treated, the
    excessive number of times superman stops what he's doing to stop something
    from falling on someone<sup aria-labelledby="supershoutout">1</sup>, and lex
    luthor's technique of beating superman by micromanaging bizarro from a
    mission control center with a walkie talkie.
  </p>
  <p>
    the movie's g-rated and almost completely bloodless.<sup
      aria-labelledby="supershit"
      >2</sup
    ><span>
      every time superman bodies someone, there's an obligatory chaser shot of
      the goon writhing around alively. the themes and characterization are
      accordingly light.</span
    ><sup aria-labelledby="superzionism">3</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    afterwards, i was like "well, that was kind of bad but i also enjoyed
    myself"
  </p>
  <p>
    but whence "that was kind of bad" ? were my expecations that this movie was
    going to be anything other than what it was? if i enjoyed myself, what's the
    actual problem?
  </p>
  <p>
    i think it's that i actually have a secret fascination with the idea of
    superman, and am really curious about how other people run the thought
    experiment of "what would happen if one person had the ultimate

      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferer"
      >monopoly on violence</a
    >?" james gunn chose to write a dramatic story, not a polsci wargame, and so
    i was a little disappointed.
  </p>
  <p>
    the superman movie i want to see is
    <strong>
      utilitarian superman hellbent on creating the conditions for global
      liberal democracy utopia.</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>some things he would do:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>throw all the nukes into the sun</li>
    <li>drop the worst guys into a volcano on live TV</li>
    <li>
      abduct all the world leaders and take them to an private island resort for
      6 months where they have to microdose LSD and do team building
      exercises<sup aria-labelledby="superhigh">4</sup>
    </li>
    <li>
      launch a global journalism fund that creates multinational newsrooms
      around the world with a rigourous commitment to truth-finding, calling out
      corruption, and fostering a cooperative consensus of reality
    </li>
    <li>
      instruct all governments to implement a plan that will end all factory
      farming in 2 years
    </li>
    <li>
      create united nations v2, staffed by the recently reprogrammed world
      leaders, mandated to create a constitution that sets the rules for how
      superman can be democratically controlled from there on
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    and i think there are a tonne of ways you could complexify the plot for
    dramatic tension, if watching a rube goldberg machine isn't your thing:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      the slippery slope from superman smashing the killer drone factory in
      ukraine to intervening in light border skirmishes between india and
      pakistan to zipping around the philippine sea to search every fishing ship
      for weapons.
    </li>
    <li>
      the supermedia organization criticizing superman the most vocally, testing
      his commitment to the ideal of free speech
    </li>
    <li>
      arguments from citizens that authoritarianism is bad, no matter how
      benevolent it is (though this is a clich√© found in every gritty comic
      book)
    </li>
    <li>
      moral leadership not filtering down into each country's institutions i.e.
      the CIA rejecting its proselyte president, and each tier of the state
      needing its own session at Camp PLUR
    </li>
    <li>
      phycisists and economists insisting he simply becomes a

        >transitional power source</a
      >
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    if you wanted to be extra cynical<sup aria-labelledby="superrepetitive"
      >5</sup
    >, you could have the movie show superman's transformation from ambitious
    idealist to the very veidt-style existential threat that humanity unites to
    defeat, but i think i'd prefer the version where, despite some bumps and
    unintended consequences along the way, things mostly work out, and the world
    reaches a stable form of peace and prosperity.
  </p>
  <p>
    i think that's the more subversive choice: taking superman's
    incorruptibility seriously and exploring what <em>world peace</em> might
    actually look like. to ask what if the real conflict isn't "will superman
    become evil" but "can humanity be forced to be free?"
  </p>
  <p>
    that would be the real punk rock thing to do.<sup

      >people are arguing that it's specifically and intentionally an
      anti-israel film, which i find kind of far-fetched. the dictator of
      boravia (vaguely eastern european-coded nation) unjustly invades jarhanpur
      (nation of defenseless people with brown skin) but the resemblance
      basically stops there. i find it far more plausible that gunn needed a
      simplistic war of aggression for his kids movie and drew as much from the
      russian invasion of ukraine, or the iraqi invasion of kuwait, or the
      soviet invasion of afghanistan as anything. if you forcibly mapped it on
      to israel-palestine, israel is more like condemnable boravia yes, but
      sometimes a generic fictional war is just a generic fictional war.
