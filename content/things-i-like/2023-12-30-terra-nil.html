    a thing i often find myself doing in factorio is building a new coal mine to
    fuel my smokestacks to power my ammunition fabricators to kill all the
    animals on the planet.
  </p>
  <p>i also often find myself thinking "this is fucking awful"</p>
  <p>
    finally, i then wonder how i could make a morally redeemable version of the
    game based on ecosystems, until i get stuck at the part where the point of
    an ecosystem is that it doesn't require effortful intervention, and go back
    to throwing grenades into nurseries.

    terra nil is South African studio
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lives">Free Lives</a>' attempt
    to get past the paradox.
  </p>
  <p>
    in factorio, you are stranded on a planet and must construct from scratch
    the technological capacity of a modern nation state to build a rocket and
    get off the planet. how this plays out is: you're a little guy running atop
    patches of ore, connecting densely packed machines with pipes and conveyor
    belts. due to a judiciously designed material versimilitude — everything you
    build requires its own raw materials and energy inputs — the very act of
    pursuing your goal more efficiently necessarily forces you to balance the
    consumption and production of your factory.
  </p>
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic">
    <p>
      this improved conveyor belt requires more steel. i'll need to increase my
      production of iron and reroute my coal supply blah blah blah...
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    ultimately, you kill most of the animals that were there first and
    industrialize enough of the planet to launch off into space again. as
    negatively as i'm framing it here, i will say that it is very, very
    satisfying to do this.
  </p>
  <p>
    in terra nil, your objective is nominally the same: work on a planet and
    leave it. the difference is that balancing resources is the explicit goal.
    the planet you land on has already been desolated, and it's your job to
    restore a healthy ecology. you do this by placing buildings on poisoned soil
    that work synergistically with each other to clean, fertilize, and germinate
    the land. doing this optimially requires you to tetris your placements
    correctly in order to minimize redundant overlap, prioritised in different
    ways depending on which stage of the level you're on - detoxicification,
    biome restoration, and fauna reintroduction. once you've done these three
    things, you also have to recycle every building you placed, leaving only
    footprints as you fly off.

  <h3>some more thoughts on the differences between the games</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      in factorio, alongside what's there to mine on the planet, your own time
      is a resource because everything has to be done or set up manually. it is
      amazing how close it can get to the "this is work" boundary without making
      you want to stop playing, because you can't accomplish your ultimate goal
      without sinking a lot of time into the game. in terra nil, there's a
      currency system and buildings appear immediately as you click on where you
      want them to be. thinking it through takes time, too, but far less time is
      spent on execution of your plan, comparatively. i think there's a lot to
      be written here on how controlling a guy versus birdseye strategy game
      agency affects the work/play boundary but if you're interested in that you
      should just go read an actual
      <a href="https://theoryoffun.com/">game theorist.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      factorio's planets aren't beautiful. despite abundant water and minerals,
      most of the planet is brown. the animals there are basically the zerg,
      with no apparent culture or behaviour beyond "swarm and attack". you could
      take pride in this - "graphics aren't the point. it's about the gameplay"
      - but i think this should be understood as more than a simple consequence
      of game development prioritisation. the planet isn't beautiful because
      makes it less disturbing to destroy. factorio players grimly joke about
      how the factory must expand, because it's already uncomfortable enough.
      imagine if the land was diverse, lush, and thriving. or if the animals all
      had names and cultures and complex societies. it would be awful. it would
      be like a first-person shooter where all the enemies are children. so
      obviously the designers haven't done that. but in terra nil, beauty coming
      back to the land is probably the largest positive reward it gives you (i
      don't really care about getting a percentage bar to 100%). aesthetics are
      quite inseperable from gameplay.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    so, i think terra nil's shift to something more akin to a puzzle, with a
    focus on aesthetic objectives is an interesting way to handle the paradox.
    it is a far shallower game. it doesn't teach you much in terms of
    fundamental principles of the universe in the way factorio does, but it was
    a calming and fun way to spend an afternoon and i think the designers of the
    future eco-factorio could take a lot of good lessons from its successes.
