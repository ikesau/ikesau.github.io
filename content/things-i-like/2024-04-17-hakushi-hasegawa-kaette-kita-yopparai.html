    <p>I died</p>
    <p>I died</p>
    <p>I died</p>
    <p>I went to Heaven</p>
    <p>I climbed up</p>
    <p>A long stairway</p>
    <p>A stairway of clouds</p>
    <p>Tottering</p>
    <p>I continued to climb</p>
    <p>Wobbling</p>
    <p>Finally I reached the gates of Heaven</p>
    <p>Come to the paradise of Heaven once</p>
    <p>Where alcohol tastes great and the ladies are pretty</p>
    <p>I died because of</p>
    <p>Drunk driving...</p>
    <p>I died</p>
    <p>I died</p>
    <p>I died</p>
    <p>I went to Heaven</p>
    <p>I died</p>
    <p>I died</p>
    <p>I died</p>
    <p>I went to Heaven</p>
    <p>But in Heaven</p>
    <p>Scary God</p>
    <p>Takes away my alcohol</p>
    <p>And always yells</p>
    <strong>"Hey you, don't you think</strong>
    <strong>that Heaven is something to take that lightly.</strong>
    <strong>Take it seriously"</strong>
    <p>Come to the paradise of Heaven once</p>
    <p>Where alcohol tastes great and the ladies are pretty</p>
    <p>I would drink alcohol</p>
    <p>Every day</p>
    <p>But I had forgotten</p>
    <p>About God</p>
    <strong>"Hey you,</strong>
    <strong>Still doing that same stuff ?</strong>
    <strong>Get out of here"</strong>
    <p>Just like that</p>
    <p>I was thrown out from Heaven</p>
    <p>I descended</p>
    <p>The stairway of clouds</p>
    <p>I descended</p>
    <p>The long stairway</p>
    <p>Missing some of the steps...</p>
    <p>When I opened my eyes</p>
    <p>I was right in the middle of a field</p>
    <p>I came back to life</p>
    <p>I came back to life</p>
