    my favourite song from this telephone explosion release (<em
      >Delicious Logo</em
    >
    by Man Made Hill), which unfortunately for my ears, mostly sounds nothing
    like this.

    the album is interesting, though. i felt compelled to defend it when sharing
    it with someone, who found it annoying and unpleasant. it's not
    <em>not</em> those things, but isn't it also lovingly made? eliding
    distortion, or screaming, or atonality - which are the more typical ways of
    making music grate - the music is written with a deliberate & boorish
    unseriousness. but it also <em>cares</em>. it's attentive to the sonic
    details of the eighties pop music that it draws from.

    it's not tim & eric, nor some kung fury-type parody. it's something that
    makes you feel really weird if you fall asleep listening to it, overtired
    and alone at two in the morning. don't ask me how i know.
