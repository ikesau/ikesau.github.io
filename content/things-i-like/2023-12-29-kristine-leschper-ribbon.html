  </a>
  <p>i've been listening to kristine's music since hearing the audiotree set of her erstwhile band mothers, and i'm delighted to hear the direction she's taken her sound</p>
  <p>this live performance of Ribbon (filmed at "the Gradwell House") is delicate and sensitive, syncopated and curious. the flute and percussion sections really distinguish the arrangement from more typical indie fare</p>
