    alt="comments from the video: @delt-4462 - The destruction of the second Death Star has taken quite a toll on Darth Vader. With the lack of funding from any planets under Imperial rule, development of a third Death Star has halted. The Imperials now desperate, Vader has decided to take to the streets of a remote planet, hoping to find aid... @tsangarisjohn - Poor Darth, he has hit rough times... From Ruler of the Galaxy to street performer. @brianc3063 - you know you're dead when vader starts stomping his boot bells @SluffAdlin - He has altered the score, pray he doesn't alter it any further @Ghost11010 - For a positive note, it's cool to see someone dress up as Darth Vader and playing the Imperial March theme on the hurdy gurdy."
