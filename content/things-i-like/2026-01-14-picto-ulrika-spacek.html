    i usually find it reductive and debasing to equate one band's music to
    another's, but sometimes a song triggers a pattern-matching reflex in me
    like a hammer to the knee. here it was the drum beat, the four-quaver snare
    fill, like "what <em>is</em> that? where have i heard that before?"

    turning the dial on my brain's radio like kip kasper, i eventually found it.

    (in the groove at the end). with rhythms, there are only so many
    permutations of ideas that are on-genre, and drumming is often an intuitive,
    trancey thing, i wonder if they noticed? i remember

    in a composition of mine once. shit happens.

    anyway. the track is lovely. the harmonies at the end are done with an AI
    voice transfer of Rhys' own vocal takes. pat flegel's been feminizing his
    voice for years now with a Voice Box, but it's cool to hear what's possible
    in front. another edge-case for the no-AI-in-art absolutists.

    i really admire this band's efforts over the last decade. since tripwires,
    and the mythical 'album written on a napkin' days, they've been doing the
    hard work of writing, saying, sounding, figuring out how to transition from
    the A section to the B section, for 4 albums and an EP. rhys's solo project,
    astrel k (see a previous

      thing i like</a
    >), also exists, in this world, where the economics of being a band trying
    to create something sensitive, caring, and true are so fucked. i'm grateful,
    and very stoked to see them again when they play in montreal.

      i first tried to transcribe the lyrics myself before noticing they were
      posted on the music video on youtube. i'm glad it happened in this order,
      because i had to listen carefully and attentively to the lyrics first, and
      discovered i like them a lot. they're repetitive & imperative, reflecting
      on our mirrors, occupying the negative space of the technology they
      critique.

    <p>The most important line?</p>
    <p>The one that comes to mind!</p>
    <p>It’s one step forward, four steps back and slide</p>
    <p>In the lowest point of the day</p>
    <p>Fortune seems to escape the brave</p>
    <p>It’s back to strength in numbers</p>
    <p>Count in fives.</p>
    <p>But come on, your world stills turns</p>
    <p>Won’t notice till it don’t</p>
    <p>Command, control, compose, invoke</p>
    <p>In blank field, cold stream</p>
    <p>Back in front but no lead</p>
    <p>It wears thin but I still feel it</p>
    <p>Blank field, cold stream</p>
    <p>Back in front but no lead</p>
    <p>It leans in but I still fit</p>
    <p>Come on, your world still turns</p>
    <p>Won’t notice till it don’t</p>
    <p>Command, control, compose, invoke.</p>
    <p>Picture perfect, broadcast worthy</p>
    <p>Send to screen</p>
    <p>The heart don’t beat in mausoleum</p>
    <p>Not excited not invited</p>
    <p>A dulcet scream comes over me, impossibly.</p>
    <p>Come on! Your world stills turns</p>
    <p>Won’t notice till it don’t</p>
    <p>Command, control, compose, invoke</p>
    <p>In blank field, cold stream</p>
    <p>Back in front but no lead</p>
    <p>It wears thin but I still feel it</p>
    <p>Blank field, cold stream</p>
    <p>Back in front but no lead</p>
    <p>It leans in but I still fit</p>
    <p>Come on, your world still turns</p>
    <p>Won’t notice till it don’t</p>
    <p>Command, control, compose, invoke.</p>
    <p>Fleeting heart in new terrain</p>
    <p>Nuisance kills the cat that feeds you</p>
    <p>Fortune seems to escape the brave</p>
    <p>Fleeting mind that’s bound to break</p>
    <p>Nuisance kills the cat that feeds you</p>
    <p>Fortune seems to escape the brave.</p>
