      The book is dead, long live the book. The Book Makers is a 1-hour
      documentary that pulls back the curtain on the people who are keeping
      books alive in the 21st century. THE BOOK MAKERS profiles an eclectic
      group of people who have dedicated their lives to answering the question:
      what should books become in the digital age? From the esoteric world of
      book artists to the digital libraries of the Internet Archive, the film
      spins a tale of the enduring vitality of the book. This engaging
      documentary captures the painstaking but pleasurable process of creating
      hand-crafted books, in a diverse range of styles and mediums. The film
      travels from New York to Germanyâ€™s Black Forest, culminating at the Codex
      Book Fair in San Francisco, where the cast of characters congregates to
      sell their books to collectors from universities and the Library of
      Congress, and to curious buyers from around the world. Along the way, THE
      BOOK MAKERS highlights the talent, dedication and skill of these book
      artists, and reframes the concept and purpose of the book itself.
