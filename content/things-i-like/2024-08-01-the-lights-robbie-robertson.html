    i would not have imagined a song as sleek and meloncholy from this wiki bio:

  <blockquote>

      Canadian musician of Indigenous ancestry. He was lead guitarist for Bob
      Dylan in the mid-late 1960s and early-mid 1970s, guitarist and songwriter

    <p>There was something strange</p>
    <p>In the sky tonight</p>
    <p>I was left standing</p>
    <p>With three moons shining</p>
    <p>Just on the outskirts of civilization</p>
    <p>I hear no longer</p>
    <p>The song of the women</p>
    <p>I hear no longer</p>
    <p>The cry of the bird</p>
    <p>I see no more</p>
    <p>The white smoke rising</p>
    <p>Only the low hum from the lights is still heard</p>
