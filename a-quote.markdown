John xii,24\n", "IN 1839 the eighteen-year-old youth Dostoevsky wrote to his brother: \u201cMan is a mystery: if you spend your entire life trying to puzzle it out, then do not say that you have wasted your time. I occupy myself with this mystery, because I want to be a man.\u201d\n", "If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God?\u201d\n", "Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He didn\u2019t need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of. He hadn\u2019t asked to be here. If he was asked at this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said ne would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply.\n", "rich ultramahogany\n", "A good death. Well, he thought, given that you had to die, why want a bad one?\n", "Yalson stirred restlessly in her seat.\u00a0\u00a0Finally she looked over at Balveda.\u00a0\u00a0The Culture woman was looking at Horza and Wubslin with a smile; she turned her head to Yalson, sensing her gaze, and smiled more widely, moving her head fractionally to indicate the two men and raising her eyebrows.\u00a0\u00a0Yalson, reluctantly, grinned back, and shifted the weight of her gun slightly.\n", "\u2018Why did you do it? Why can\u2019t you stop?\u2019\n", "We think of our eyes as open windows and our ears as empty tubes. We experience the out-there as if we are a tiny homunculus gazing from holes in our heads at a world that is flooded with light, music and colour. But this is not true. The things that you are seeing right now are not out there in front of you, but inside your head, being reconstructed in more than thirty sites across your brain. The light is not out there. The objects are not out there. The music is not out there. A violin has no sound without a brain to process it; a rose petal has no colour. It is all a re-creation. A vision. A useful guess about what the world might look like, that is built well enough that we are able to negotiate it successfully.\n", "would a \u2018streetwise\u2019 man or a \u2018formally educated\u2019 woman be better suited to the job? The majority chose the man. When asked why, they said that they had thought carefully about this, and decided that it would be most useful for a police chief to be streetwise. For a second group, researchers switched the genders. This time, the male candidate was \u2018formally educated\u2019 and the female was \u2018streetwise\u2019. The majority chose the man. When asked why, they said that they had thought carefully about this, and decided that it would be most useful for a police chief to be formally educated. It is a discomforting thing, reading of these ordinary men and women, who presumably consider themselves to be kind and rational and fair, operating in such an unknowingly prejudiced manner. The study suggests that they had no idea why they believe what they believe, why they say what they say.\n", "cognitive error we all share, known as the spotlight effect, means that we go through our social lives convinced that everything we are saying, doing and feeling is being closely examined by those around us even though, in reality, they are all preoccupied with themselves, equally convinced the spotlight is on them.\n", "one of the most disturbing revelations of neuroscience is that our sense of being \u2018out there\u2019 in the world is an illusion. We are stuck inside our skulls and the rich sensory landscape of sights and sounds and colours and smells that we think we are moving about in is actually a reconstruction.\n", "\u2018between a third and a half of the variability among people on their political attitudes.\u2019\n", "Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother.\n", "Homo denisova\n", "also suffered less from infectious diseases. Most of the infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial societies (such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis) originated in domesticated animals and were transferred to humans only after the Agricultural Revolution.\n", "Hunter-gatherers made these handprints about 9,000 years ago in the \u2018Hands Cave\u2019, in Argentina. It looks as if these long-dead hands are reaching towards us from within the rock. This is one of the most moving relics of the ancient forager world \u2013 but nobody knows what it means.\n", "Archaeologists are familiar with such monumental structures from sites around the world \u2013 the best-known example is Stonehenge in Britain. Yet as they studied G\u00f6bekli Tepe, they discovered an amazing fact. Stonehenge dates to 2500 BC, and was built by a developed agricultural society. The structures at G\u00f6bekli Tepe are dated to about 9500 BC, and all available evidence indicates that they were built by hunter-gatherers.\n", "combination of base-6 and base-10 numeral systems. Their base-6 system bestowed on us several important legacies, such as the division of the day into twenty-four hours and of the circle into 360 degrees.)\n", "It didn\u2019t disturb the Sumerians that their script was ill-suited for writing poetry. They didn\u2019t invent it in order to copy spoken language, but rather to do things that spoken language failed at.\n", "Eventually the original four castes turned into 3,000 different groupings called jati (literally \u2018birth\u2019). But this proliferation of castes did not change the basic principle of the system, according to which every person is born into a particular rank, and any infringement of its rules pollutes the person and society as a whole. A person\u2019s jati determines her profession, the food she can eat, her place of residence and her eligible marriage partners.\n", "No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other.\n", "If one hundred different commodities are traded in the market, then buyers and sellers will have to know 4,950 different exchange rates. And if 1,000 different commodities are traded, buyers and sellers must juggle 499,500 different exchange rates! How do you figure it out?\n", "The first coins in history were struck around 640 BC by King Alyattes of Lydia, in western Anatolia.\n", "The name \u2018denarius\u2019 became a generic name for coins. Muslim caliphs Arabicised this name and issued \u2018dinars\u2019. The dinar is still the official name of the currency in Jordan, Iraq, Serbia, Macedonia, Tunisia and several other countries.\n", "The Senate decided to send Scipio Aemilianus, Rome\u2019s foremost general and the man who had levelled Carthage, to take care of the Numantians. He was given a massive army of more than 30,000 soldiers. Scipio, who respected the fighting spirit and martial skill of the Numantians, preferred not to waste his soldiers in unnecessary combat. Instead, he encircled Numantia with a line of fortifications, blocking the town\u2019s contact with the outside world. Hunger did his work for him. After more than a year, the food supply ran out. When the Numantians realised that all hope was lost, they burned down their town; according to Roman accounts, most of them killed themselves so as not to become Roman slaves. Numantia later became a symbol of Spanish independence and courage. Miguel de Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote, wrote a tragedy called The Siege of Numantia which ends with the town\u2019s destruction, but also with a vision of Spain\u2019s future greatness.\n", "Chaotic systems come in two shapes. Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts.\n", "Equipped with the most advanced scientific instruments that Banks and the Royal Society could buy, the expedition was placed under the command of Captain James Cook, an experienced seaman as well as an accomplished geographer and ethnographer. The expedition left England in 1768, observed the Venus transit from Tahiti in 1769, reconnoitred several Pacific islands, visited Australia and New Zealand, and returned to England in 1771.\n", "Astronomers predicted that the next Venus transits would occur in 1761 and 1769. So expeditions were sent from Europe to the four corners of the world in order to observe the transits from as many distant points as possible.\n", "When he calmed down, the astronauts asked him what it meant. The man explained that the sentence they had memorised so carefully said, \u2018Don\u2019t believe a single word these people are telling you. They have come to steal your lands.\u2019\n", "Around 1517, Spanish colonists in the Caribbean islands began to hear vague rumours about a powerful empire somewhere in the centre of the Mexican mainland. A mere four years later, the Aztec capital was a smouldering ruin, the Aztec Empire was a thing of the past, and Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s lorded over a vast new Spanish Empire in Mexico.\n", "You think that these empires were evil monstrosities that spread death, oppression and injustice around the world? You could easily fill an encyclopedia with their crimes. You want to argue that they in fact improved the conditions of their subjects with new medicines, better economic conditions and greater security? You could fill another encyclopedia with their achievements. Due to their close cooperation with science, these empires wielded so much power and changed the world to such an extent that perhaps they cannot be simply labelled as good or evil. They created the world as we know it, including the ideologies we use in order to judge them.\n", "The empires built by bankers and merchants in frock coats and top hats defeated the empires built by kings and noblemen in gold clothes and shining armour. The mercantile empires were simply much shrewder in financing their conquests.\n", "While VOC operated in the Indian Ocean, the Dutch West Indies Company, or WIC, plied the Atlantic. In order to control trade on the important Hudson River, WIC built a settlement called New Amsterdam on an island at the river\u2019s mouth. The colony was threatened by Indians and repeatedly attacked by the British, who eventually captured it in 1664. The British changed its name to New York. The remains of the wall built by WIC to defend its colony against Indians and British are today paved over by the world\u2019s most famous street \u2013 Wall Street.\n", "The Mississippi Bubble was one of history\u2019s most spectacular financial crashes. The royal French financial system never recuperated fully from the blow. The way in which the Mississippi Company used its political clout to manipulate share prices and fuel the buying frenzy caused the public to lose faith in the French banking system and in the financial wisdom of the French king. Louis XV found it more and more difficult to raise credit. This became one of the chief reasons that the overseas French Empire fell into British hands.\n", "In 1840 Britain duly declared war on China in the name of \u2018free trade\u2019. It was a walkover. The overconfident Chinese were no match for Britain\u2019s new wonder weapons \u2013 steamboats, heavy artillery, rockets and rapid-fire rifles. Under the subsequent peace treaty, China agreed not to constrain the activities of British drug merchants and to compensate them for damages inflicted by the Chinese police. Furthermore, the British demanded and received control of Hong Kong, which they proceeded to use as a secure base for drug trafficking (Hong Kong remained in British hands until 1997). In the late nineteenth century, about 40 million Chinese, a tenth of the country\u2019s population, were opium addicts.\n", "In 1881 Egyptian nationalists had had enough and rebelled. They declared a unilateral abrogation of all foreign debt. Queen Victoria was not amused. A year later she dispatched her army and navy to the Nile and Egypt remained a British protectorate until after World War Two.\n", "From the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, about 10 million African slaves were imported to America. About 70 per cent of them worked on the sugar plantations.\n", "Finally, in 1880, the British government took the unprecedented step of legislating that all timetables in Britain must follow Greenwich. For the first time in history, a country adopted a national time and obliged its population to live according to an artificial clock rather than local ones or sunrise-to-sunset cycles.\n", "If we accept the biological approach to happiness, then history turns out to be of minor importance, since most historical events have had no impact on our biochemistry. History can change the external stimuli that cause serotonin to be secreted, yet it does not change the resulting serotonin levels, and hence it cannot make people happier.\n", "Once they wrote poetry. Now it\u2019s the laundry list.\n", "Lucy Stone said in 1855: From the first years to which my memory stretches, I have been a disappointed woman. When, with my brothers, I reached forth after sources of knowledge, I was reproved with \u201cIt isn\u2019t fit for you; it doesn\u2019t belong to women\u201d\u2026In education, in marriage, in religion, in everything, disappointment is the lot of woman. It shall be the business of my life to deepen this disappointment in every woman\u2019s heart until she bows down to it no longer.8\n", "Women who displayed any independence or initiative were called \u201cLucy Stoners.\u201d \u201cFeminist,\u201d like \u201ccareer woman,\u201d became a dirty word.\n", "Did women really go home again as a reaction to feminism? The fact is that to women born after 1920, feminism was dead history. It ended as a vital movement in America with the winning of that final right: the vote. In the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s, the sort of woman who fought for woman\u2019s rights was still concerned with human rights and freedom\u2014for Negroes, for oppressed workers, for victims of Franco\u2019s Spain and Hitler\u2019s Germany. But no one was much concerned with rights for women: they had all been won. And yet the man-eating myth prevailed. Women who displayed any independence or initiative were called \u201cLucy Stoners.\u201d \u201cFeminist,\u201d like \u201ccareer woman,\u201d became a dirty word.\n", "Protectiveness has often muffled the sound of doors closing against women;\n", "\u201cThe Queen is most anxious to enlist everyone who can speak or write to join in checking this mad, wicked folly of \u2018Woman\u2019s Rights\u2019 with all its attendant horrors, on which her poor feeble sex is bent, forgetting every sense of womanly feeling and propriety\u2026. It is a subject which makes the Queen so furious that she cannot contain herself. God created men and women different\u2014then let them remain each in their own position.\u201d\n", "It didn't include acts-of-war insurance. And let me tell you, ma'am, when we land Iorek Byrnison on Svalbard, that will count as an act of war.\" He spat a piece of smokeleaf delicately overboard. \"So I'd like to know what we can expect in the way of mayhem and ructions,\" he finished.\n", "Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about\u2014however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way\u2014either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other\u2019s shoulder-blades, and be content.\n", "The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us.\n", "Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces\u2014though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.\n", "But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this \u201cSpouter\u201d may be.\n", "enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite, halfattained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant.\n", "Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.\n", "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time.\n", "What under the heavens he did it for,\n", "Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea.\n", "In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman\u2019s Chapel, and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.

But somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems\u2014aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling\u2014a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity.\n", "At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom\u2014the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February\u2019s snow.\n", "\u201cAh, noble ship,\u201d the angel seemed to say, \u201cbeat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling off\u2014serenest azure is at hand.\u201d\n", "\u201cThe ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom, While all God\u2019s sun-lit waves rolled by, And left me deepening down to doom. \u201cI saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there; Which none but they that feel can tell\u2014 Oh, I was plunging to despair. \u201cIn black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints\u2014 No more the whale did me confine. \u201cWith speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne; Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God. \u201cMy song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.\u201d\n", "Ha! Jonah, that\u2019s another stab.

And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.\n", "\u201cScrewed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah\u2019s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. \u2018Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!\u2019 he groans, \u2018straight upward, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!\u2019\n", "He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit\u2019s bows, folded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea.\n", "But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do\u2014remember that\u2014and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.\n", "Thought he, it\u2019s a wicked world in all meridians; I\u2019ll die a pagan.\n", "till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.

How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man\u2019s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\n", "\u201cI dost,\u201d said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n", "\u201cAnd a very vile one.

Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters.

For in their succorless emptyhandedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared.

For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in readiness anew.

For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such gladhearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.\n", "Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with aught that looks like death.\n", "Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.\n", "Dough-Boy\u2019s whole life was one continual lipquiver.\n", "The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant\u2014the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\n", "I say: your whales must be seen before they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates:\u2014 \u201cRoll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.\u201d\n", "Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk.

That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity.\n", "with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.\n", "Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan\u2014do you suppose that that poor fellow\u2019s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read tomorrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others, we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat\u2019s crew. For God\u2019s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man\u2019s blood was spilled for it.\n", "Starbuck\u2019s body and Starbuck\u2019s coerced will were Ahab\u2019s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck\u2019s brain;\n", "Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.

I\u2019m bressed if he ain\u2019t more of shark dan Massa Shark himself,\u201d muttered the old man, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.\n", "When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a\u2019lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two, for an hour each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well. But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod\u2019s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.\n", "\u201cQueequeg no care what god made him shark,\u201d said the savage, agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; \u201cwedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.\u201d\n", "\u201cSpeak, thou vast and venerable head,\u201d muttered Ahab, \u201cwhich, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast dived the deepest.

As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale\u2019s eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all.\n", "The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.

As devout Eckermanne1 lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.\n", "well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get won\u2019t be enough to dip the Captain\u2019s wick into;\n", "\u201cStick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I wont pick you up if you jump; mind that.

Bear that in, mind, and don\u2019t jump any more.\u201d Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loves his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n", "As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,\u2014literally and truly, like the smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger: while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever. Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers\u2019 hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,\u2014Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.\n", "Greek fire.\n", "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,\n", "Oh, you solemn rogue, you\u2014you Bunger! was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world?

What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?\u201d holding it high up. A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale\u2019s barbs were then tempered. \u201cEgo non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!\u201d deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood.\n", "As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain\u2019s and officers\u2019 state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain\u2019s pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.\n", "Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune\u2019s favorites sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out.\n", "Then falling into a moment\u2019s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself: \u201cThou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I am\u2014but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be?

Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast man\u2019s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth\u2019s horizon are the glances of man\u2019s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!\u201d dashing it to the deck, \u201cno longer will I guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship\u2019s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by log and by line; these shall conduct me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye,\u201d lighting from the boat to the deck, \u201cthus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and destroy thee!\u201d\n", "Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship\u2019s course to be changed accordingly. The yards were braced hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her. Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask\u2014who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings\u2014likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced.

I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck he was still living for. I mean he was all stooped over, and he had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him. That's awful, in my opinion. But if you thought about him just enough and not too much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing too bad for himself. For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park. You could tell old Spencer'd got a big bang out of buying it. That's what I mean.

And it had two shadows, it was two things; it was the need and it was the method. The need was obvious; to defeat what opposed its life. The method was that taking and bending of materials and people to one purpose, the outlook that everything could be used in the fight; that nothing could be excluded, that everything was a weapon, and the ability to handle those weapons, to find them and choose which one to aim and fire; that talent, that ability, that use of weapons.\n", "But I don't know what the right thing to do is; I sometimes think I know too much, I've studied too much, learned too much, remembered too much.

In numerous shooting cases, officers have failed to turn on their cameras. For example: One of the officers present at the shooting of Walter Scott in Charleston did not have his camera turned on. Not a single one of the officers present at a shooting in Washington, D.C., in 2016 had their camera on. Eighteen-year-old Paul O\u2019Neil was killed by police in Chicago who did not have their cameras on. One study actually found that departments using cameras had higher rates of shootings. Ultimately, body cameras are only as effective as the accountability mechanisms in place.\n", "Any hope we have of holding police more accountable must be based on greater openness and transparency. Police departments are notoriously defensive and insular. Their special status as the sole legitimate users of force has contributed to a mindset of \u201cthem against us,\u201d which has engendered a culture of secrecy. For too long police have walled themselves off from public inspection, open academic research, and media investigations. Entrenched practices that serve no legitimate purpose, failed policies, implicit and explicit racism among the rank and file, and a culture of hostility toward the public must be rooted out.\n", "They have given up on using government to improve racial and economic inequality and seem hellbent on worsening these inequalities and using the police to manage the consequences.\n", "Too often, when biased policing is pointed out, the response is to circle the wagons, deny any intent to do harm, and block any discipline against the officers involved. This sends an unambiguous message that officers are above the law and free to act on their biases without consequence. It also says that the institution is more concerned about defending itself than rooting out these problems.\n", "policing emerged as new political and economic formations developed, producing social upheavals that could no longer be managed by existing private, communal, and informal processes.3 This can be seen in the earliest origins of policing, which were tied to three basic social arrangements of inequality in the eighteenth century: slavery, colonialism, and the control of a new industrial working class.\n", "Most liberal and conservative academics attempt to counter this argument by pointing to the London Metropolitan Police, held up as the \u201coriginal\u201d police force. Created in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel, from whom the \u201cBobbies\u201d get their name, this new force was more effective than the informal and unprofessional \u201cwatch\u201d or the excessively violent and often hated militia and army. But even this noble endeavor had at its core not fighting crime, but managing disorder and protecting the propertied classes from the rabble. Peel developed his ideas while managing the British colonial occupation of Ireland and seeking new forms of social control that would allow for continued political and economic domination in the face of growing insurrections, riots, and political uprisings.7 For years, such \u201coutrages\u201d had been managed by the local militia and, if necessary, the British Army. However, colonial expansion and the Napoleonic Wars dramatically reduced the availability of these forces just as resistance to British occupation increased. Furthermore, armed troops had limited tools for dealing with riots and others forms of mass disorder. Too often they were called upon to open fire on crowds, creating martyrs and further inflaming Irish resistance. Peel was forced to develop a lower-cost and more legitimate form of policing: a \u201cPeace Preservation Force,\u201d made up of professional police who attempted to manage crowds by embedding themselves more fully in rebellious localities, then identifying and neutralizing troublemakers and ringleaders through threats and arrests. This led eventually to the creation of the Royal Irish Constabulary, which for about a century was the main rural police force in Ireland. It played a central role in maintaining British rule and an oppressive agricultural system dominated by British loyalists, a system that produced widespread poverty, famine, and displacement.\n", "At the epicenter of this transformation is Texas, where privatization and drastic cuts to the public sector meet the expansion of punitive mechanisms of social control. Texas was an early adopter of high-stakes testing in the 1990s. As governor, George W. Bush expanded its role and implemented a series of punitive measures, mostly focused on zero-tolerance approaches. Since, as we\u2019ve seen, testing motivates teachers to remove low-performing and disruptive students from class, suspension rates went through the roof\u201495 percent of them for minor infractions. By 2009\u201310 there were 2 million suspensions in Texas, 1.9 million of which were for \u201cviolating local code of conduct\u201d rather than a more serious offense. To deal with this onslaught of suspensions, for-profit companies with close ties to state Republican leaders developed what Annette Fuentes calls \u201csupermax schools.\u201d11 These schools use fingerprint scanners, metal detectors, frequent searches, heavy video surveillance, and intense disciplinary systems to manage kids kicked out of regular schools. In many cases there is no talking allowed in hallways or lunchrooms. Teachers have little specialized training, and the low pay means fewer certified teachers than in regular schools. The emphasis is on computer-based learning and frequent testing. Outside evaluations have been tightly controlled; the few external reviews have found terrible performance and prison-like conditions. Overall, the claimed \u201cTexas Miracle\u201d of improved test scores was based on faked test results, astronomical suspension and dropout rates, and the shunting of problem students to prison-like schools outside the state testing regime. Bush rode this chicanery all the way to the White House, where he instituted it nationally in the form of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n", "are encourage to\n", "A Columbia University study found that children receiving RCCP instruction from their teachers developed more positively than their peers: they saw their social world in a less hostile way, saw violence as an unacceptable option, and chose nonviolent ways to resolve conflict.

We must find better ways to keep kids safe than turning their schools into armed fortresses and prisons. It\u2019s time to take police out of the schools and reject the harsh punitive focus of school management. Our young people need compassion and care, not coercion and control.\n", "But there are worse places to live. There are much worse places right here in this U-Stor-It.

All of a sudden, as I rounded a turn, part of the slough came into view. In that brilliant, surprising blue, I saw them: hundreds, maybe thousands of birds, congregating in the shallows and rising into the sky in giant glittering flocks that turned from black to silver as they changed direction. Unexpectedly, I started crying. Although this site would certainly be classified as \u201cnatural,\u201d it appeared to me like nothing short of a miracle, one I felt I or this world somehow didn\u2019t deserve. In its unlikely splendor, the slough seemed to represent all of the threatened spaces, all that stood to be lost, that was already being lost. But I also realized for the first time that my wish to preserve this place was also a self-preservation instinct, insofar as I needed spaces like this too, and insofar as I couldn\u2019t feel truly at home in a solely human community. I withered without this contact; a life without other life didn\u2019t seem worth living. To acknowledge that this space and everything in it was endangered meant acknowledging that I, too, was endangered. The wildlife refuge was my refuge. It\u2019s a bit like falling in love\u2014that terrifying realization that your fate is linked to someone else\u2019s, that you are no longer your own. But isn\u2019t that closer to the truth anyway? Our fates are linked, to each other, to the places where we are, and everyone and everything that lives in them. How much more real my responsibility feels when I think about it this way! This is more than just an abstract understanding that our survival is threatened by global warming, or even a cerebral appreciation for other living beings and systems.

Of course, that didn\u2019t mean not interfering at all. Fukuoka recalls the time he tried to let some orchard trees grow without pruning: the trees\u2019 branches became intertwined and the orchard was attacked by insects. \u201cThis is abandonment, not \u2018natural farming,\u2019\u201d he writes. Somewhere between over-engineering and abandonment, Fukuoka found the sweet spot by patiently listening and observing. His expertise lay in being a quiet and patient collaborator with the ecosystem he tended to. Fukuoka\u2019s stance is an example of something that Jedediah Purdy suggests in his book After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene. In each subsequent chapter, Purdy shows how the different views of nature throughout history have each corresponded to a set of political beliefs about value and subjecthood, being used to justify everything from hierarchical social orders and racism (\u201ceverything in its place\u201d) to an obsession with the productivity of industry.\n", "Be kind to guests while they are visiting, then help them on their way.

Slave owners may have been concerned for the survival of individual slaves, who, after all, represented significant investments. Convicts, on the other hand, were leased not as individuals, but as a group, and they could be worked literally to death without affecting the profitability of a convict crew. According to descriptions by contemporaries, the conditions under which leased convicts and county chain gangs lived were far worse than those under which black people had lived as slaves. The records of Mississippi plantations in the Yazoo Delta during the late 1880s indicate that the prisoners ate and slept on bare ground, without blankets or mattresses, and often without clothes.

The death of the Giant Creator was an essential part of the creation process, because fragments of his own body helped to complete the world.

The last of his breath forged the wind and clouds, while his sweat became rain.

In The Story of the Heavens, he was of the opinion that astronomers were at the limits of knowledge: \u2018We have already reached a point where man\u2019s intellect begins to fail to yield him any more light, and where his imagination has succumbed in the endeavour to realise even the knowledge he has gained.\u2019 Similar statements had probably been made by some ancient Greeks dismissing the possibility of measuring the size of the Earth or the distance to the Sun.\n", "Figure 41 shows a plot of Delta Cephei\u2019s variation. The most striking feature is the lack of symmetry. Whereas the Algol plot (Figure 40) displays a series of thin, symmetric valleys, Delta Cephei ramps up to peak brightness in just a day and then gradually fades to a minimum over the course of four days. Eta Aquilae showed a similar sawtooth or shark\u2019s-fin pattern. This pattern cannot be explained by any sort of eclipse effect, so the two young men assumed that there must be something intrinsic to the two stars that was causing the variation. They decided that Eta Aquilae and Delta Cephei belonged to a new class of variable star, which we now call Cepheid variables, or simply Cepheids. Some Cepheids are very subtle, such as Polaris, the North Star, which is our closest Cepheid.\n", "Unfortunately, he soon became frustrated because of his team\u2019s lack of concentration and failure to pay attention to detail. One day, when his patience had been exhausted, he blurted out that his Scotch maid could do a better job. To prove his point, he sacked his allmale team, hired women computers to replace them and put his maid in charge.Williamina Fleming had been a teacher in Scotland before emigrating to America, where she had been abandoned by her husband when pregnant, forcing her to take a job as a housekeeper. Now she was leading a team nicknamed \u2018Pickering\u2019s harem\u2019 and scrutinising the world\u2019s largest set of astronomical images. Pickering is generally respected for his liberal recruitment policy, but to some extent he was motivated by practical issues.The women were generally more accurate and meticulous than the men they replaced, and they also tolerated being paid between 25 and 30 cents per hour, whereas the men had demanded 50 cents. Also, the women were restricted to the role of computers and were denied the opportunity to make observations themselves. This was partly because the telescopes were housed in cold, dark observatories, which were considered unsuitable for the fairer sex, and partly because Victorian sensitivities would have been offended by the thought of a man and a woman working together late into the night, staring up at the romantic array of stars. But at least the women could now examine the photographic results of night-time observations and contribute to astronomy, a discipline that had largely excluded them in the past.\n", "the cooler the star, the greater its tendency to emit long wavelengths and the redder it appears. Conversely, the hotter the star, the greater its tendency to emit short wavelengths and the bluer it appears.\n", "The shift in wavelength and pitch is highly predictable thanks to an equation developed by Doppler. The received wavelength (\u03bbr) depends on the initial emitted wavelength (\u03bb), and the ratio between the speed of the emitter (ve) and the speed of the wave (vw). If the emitter is travelling towards the observer, then ve is reckoned as positive, and it if is travelling away from the observer then it is negative:\n", "Cosmologists are often in error, but never in doubt.\n", "Alpher and Herman continued to develop their early history of the universe and wondered what else might happen to this sea of light and plasma as the universe expanded with time. They realised that as the universe expanded, its energy would become spread through a greater volume, so the universe and the plasma within it would steadily cool. The two young physicists deduced that there would be a critical moment when the temperature would become too cool for a plasma to exist, at which point the electrons would latch on to nuclei and form stable, neutral atoms of hydrogen and helium. The transition from plasma to atoms happens at roughly 3,000\u00b0C for hydrogen and helium, and the duo estimated that it would take 300,000 years or so for the universe to cool to this temperature.\n", "Alpher and Herman estimated that the sea of light released at the moment of recombination had a wavelength of roughly one-thousandth of a millimetre. This wavelength was a direct consequence of the temperature of the universe when the plasma fog cleared, which was 3,000\u00b0C. However, all these light waves would have been stretched because the universe has been expanding ever since recombination. This was similar to the stretching and redshift of light from the apparently receding galaxies, which had already been measured by astronomers such as Hubble. Alpher and Herman confidently predicted that the stretched Big Bang light should now have a wavelength of roughly a millimetre. This wavelength is invisible to the human eye, and is located in the so-called microwave region of the spectrum. Alpher and Herman were making a specific prediction. The universe should be full of a feeble microwave light with a wavelength of one millimetre, and it should be coming from all directions because it had existed everywhere in the universe at the moment of recombination. Anybody who could detect this so-called cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB radiation) would prove that the Big Bang really happened. Immortality was waiting for whoever could make the measurement.\n", "Gamow also became famous for Mr Tompkins in Wonderland, a book in which he described a world where the speed of light was just a few kilometres per hour, so that a bicycle ride would reveal the weird effects of relativity, such as time dilation and length contraction.\n", "The inspiration for this new model seems to have come from a film called Dead of Night, released in September 1945. Although it was made by Ealing Studios, it was a far cry from their usual output of genteel English comedies. In fact, it was the first horror film to be made in Britain after the repeal of wartime censorship, which had prohibited any form of entertainment that might damage morale.\n", "producer and fellow Cambridge academic Peter Laslett disregarded the warning label and invited Hoyle to broadcast a series of five lectures on the Third Programme radio network. The series was aired at eight o\u2019clock on Saturday evenings, and transcripts were published in the Listener magazine. The entire project was a huge success, turning Hoyle into a celebrity. The radio series is still remembered today because of a historic moment in the final lecture. Although the term \u2018Big Bang\u2019 has appeared in previous chapters of this book, its use has actually been anachronistic, because the term was originated by Hoyle during this radio broadcast. Up until the moment that Hoyle coined this catchy title, the theory had generally been known as the dynamic evolving model. The term \u2018Big Bang\u2019 emerged while Hoyle was explaining that there were two rival theories of the cosmos. There was, of course, his own Steady State model, and then there was the model which involved a moment of creation: One of them is distinguished by the assumption that the universe started its life a finite time ago in a single huge explosion. On this supposition, the present expansion is a relic of the violence of this explosion. Now this Big Bang idea seemed to me to be unsatisfactory\u2026On scientific grounds this Big Bang assumption is much the less palatable of the two. For it is an irrational process that cannot be described in scientific terms\u2026On philosophical grounds, too, I cannot see any good reason for preferring the Big Bang idea.\n", "In the Soviet Union, the influence was not theological but political, and it was not pro-Big-Bang but anti-Big-Bang. Soviet ideologues were antagonistic towards the Big Bang model because it failed to comply with the tenets of Marxist-Leninist ideology. In particular, they could not accept any model that posited a moment of creation, because creation was synonymous with a Creator. Also, they perceived the Big Bang as a Western theory, even though it was Alexander Friedmann in St Petersburg who had laid its foundations. Andrei Zhdanov, who helped to coordinate the Stalinist purges of the 1930s and 1940s, encapsulated the Soviet position on the Big Bang: \u2018Falsifiers of science want to revive the fairy tale of the origin of the world from nothing.\u2019 He sought out and persecuted those he called \u2018Lema\u00eetre\u2019s agents\u2019. His victims included the astrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev, who was sent to a labour camp in 1937 and sentenced to be executed for continuing to discuss his belief in the Big Bang model. Fortunately his death sentence was commuted to ten years\u2019 incarceration when officials were unable to drum up a firing squad. After appeals by his colleagues, Kozyrev was eventually released and allowed to return to work at the Pulkovo Observatory. Vsevolod Frederiks and Matvei Bronstein, who were also supporters of the Big Bang model, received the harshest punishments of all. Frederiks was imprisoned in a series of camps and died after six years of hard labour, while Bronstein was shot after being arrested on trumped-up charges of being a spy. By making examples of these and other scientists, the Soviets effectively gagged serious cosmological research and delivered a message that echoed on through the decades of Communism. The Russian astronomer V.E. Lov followed the party line by stating that the Big Bang model is a \u2018cancerous tumour that corrodes modern astronomical theory and is the main ideological enemy of materialist science\u2019. And Boris Vorontsov-Vel\u2019iaminov, one of Lov\u2019s colleagues, maintained solidarity by calling Gamow an \u2018Americanised apostate\u2019 because of his defection to the West, stating that he \u2018advances new theories only for the sake of sensation\u2019.\n", "The fact that politicians and theologians alike were using cosmology to shore up their beliefs struck Hoyle as ridiculous. As he wrote in 1956:\u2018Both Catholics and Communists argue by dogma. An argument is judged \u201cright\u201d by these people because they judge it to be based on \u201cright\u201d premises, not because it leads to results that accord with the facts. Indeed, if the facts should disagree with the dogma then so much worse for the facts.\u2019\n", "by the 1940s it was becoming evident that most stars could be grouped into two broad types, called populations. Older stars belong to Population II, and after these stars have expired their debris becomes an ingredient of newer, younger, Population I stars, which are generally hotter, brighter and bluer than their counterparts in Population II. Baade assumed that Cepheids were also split into these two categories, and suggested that this was what lay behind the contradictions over the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade\u2019s argument that Andromeda was farther away was based on two simple steps. First, Population I Cepheids are intrinsically brighter than Population II Cepheids that have the same period of variation. And second, astronomers tended to see only the brighter Population I Cepheids in the Andromeda Galaxy, but they had inadvertently built their Cepheid distance scale by using the dimmer Population II Cepheids in the Milky Way. Unaware that there were two types of Cepheid, Hubble had made the mistake of comparing dim, local Population II Cepheids with Andromeda\u2019s relatively bright Population I Cepheids. The consequence was that he had erroneously estimated the Andromeda Galaxy to be closer than it really is.\n", "Astronomers could not use the Cepheid yardstick technique for measuring the distance to the farthest galaxies because it had been impossible to detect Cepheid variable stars so far away. Instead, they were forced to adopt a completely different measuring technique, which relied on the reasonable assumption that the brightest star in the Andromeda Galaxy was intrinsically as bright as the brightest star in any other galaxy. Therefore, if the brightest star in a distant galaxy was apparently 1/100 (1/102) as bright as the brightest star in Andromeda, then the distant galaxy was assumed to be 10 times farther away, because brightness falls off with the square of the distance.\n", "Thanks to improved photography, Sandage could see that what had been repeatedly perceived as the brightest star in a distant galaxy was in fact something else altogether. Much of the hydrogen in the universe has coalesced into familiar compact stars, but there is also a significant amount of it in the form of vast clouds known as HII regions. An HII region absorbs light from surrounding stars, which heats it to over 10,000\u00b0C. Because of its temperature and size, an HII region can outshine almost any star. Before Sandage, astronomers had been accidentally and incorrectly comparing the brightest star visible in the Andromeda Galaxy with the brightest HII region in more distant, newly discovered galaxies. Thinking that the HII regions were stars, astronomers had assumed that these new galaxies were relatively close because their brightest \u2018stars\u2019 appeared to be comparatively bright. When Sandage obtained images that were sharp enough to distinguish these HII regions from genuine stars, he concluded that the brightest genuine stars in distant galaxies were actually much fainter than the misinterpreted HII regions, so the galaxies had to be farther away than previously estimated.\n", "Hoyle wanted to understand what would happen towards the end of a star\u2019s life, when it began to run out of hydrogen fuel. Not surprisingly, the fuel shortage would cause the star to begin to cool down. The fall in temperature would result in a fall in outward pressure, and the gravitational force would become overpowering and would initiate a stellar contraction. Crucially, however, Hoyle realised that this contraction was not the end of the story. As the entire star falls inwards, the compression would cause the stellar core to heat up and generate an increased outward pressure, which would halt the collapse. The temperature rise associated with compression has several causes, but one of them is that compression encourages more nuclear reactions, resulting in the generation of more heat. Although this extra heat re-establishes some level of stability in the star, it is only a temporary hiatus; the star\u2019s death has only been deferred. The star continues to consume more fuel, and eventually its dwindling fuel supply becomes critical. Lack of fuel means lack of energy production, so the core begins to cool again, which leads to another collapsing phase. Again, this heats the core, again halting the collapse until the next fuel shortage. This stop\u2014start collapse means that many stars endure a slow, lingering death. Hoyle set about analysing the various types of star (e.g. small, medium, large, Population I, Population II), and after several years of dedicated research he successfully completed his calculations of all the temperature and pressure changes that happened in different stars as they neared the end of their lives. Most importantly of all, he also worked out the nuclear reactions in each death spasm, and crucially showed how the various combinations of extreme temperatures and pressures could lead to a whole range of medium-weight and heavyweight atomic nuclei,\n", "Marcus Chown, author of The Magic Furnace, described the significance of stellar alchemy as follows: \u2018In order that we might live, stars in their billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions even, have died. The iron in our blood, the calcium in our bones, the oxygen that fills our lungs each time we take a breath\u2014all were cooked in the furnaces of the stars\n", "Hoyle\u2019s premise was that he existed in the universe. Furthermore, he pointed out, he was a carbon-based life form. Therefore carbon existed in the universe, so there must have been a way of creating carbon. However, the only way to create carbon seemed to rely on the existence of a specific excited state of carbon. Consequently, such an excited state must exist. Hoyle was rigorously applying what would later become known as the anthropic principle. This principle can be defined and interpreted in various ways, but one version states: We are here to study the universe, so the laws of the universe must be compatible with our own existence.\n", "After ten days of analysing the carbon-12 nucleus, Fowler\u2019s team found a new excited state. It was at 7.65 MeV, exactly where Hoyle said it should be. This was the first and only time that a scientist had made a prediction using the anthropic principle and had been proved right. It was an instance of extreme genius. At last, Hoyle had proved and identified the mechanism by which helium could be transformed into beryllium and then into carbon. He had confirmed that carbon was synthesised at temperatures of roughly 200,000,000\u00b0C via the reaction shown in Figure 89(b). It was a slow process, but billions of stars over billions of years could create significant amounts of carbon. And explaining the creation of carbon confirmed the starting point for the other nuclear reactions that created all the other elements in the universe.\n", "He was detecting the well-established wavelengths associated with hydrogen, except that they had been redshifted to an extent never seen before. This was astonishing because 3C 273 was supposed to be a local star, and local stars travel at less than 50 km/s, far too low a speed to account for the redshift observed by Schmidt. In fact, the redshift measurements implied that 3C 273 was receding at 48,000 km/s, roughly 16% of the speed of light. According to Hubble\u2019s law, this implied that 3C 273 was the most distant object ever detected, over a billion light years from the Milky Way. Object 3C 273 was not a reasonably bright local star, but a fantastically brilliant far-off galaxy, several hundred times brighter than the brightest galaxies hitherto known. However, its brightness was largely in the form of radio waves rather than visible light. 3C 273 became known as a quasi-stellar radio object (or quasar), because it was a radio galaxy whose extreme distance and brightness gave it the deceptive appearance of a local star. It was not long before several other radio sources were identified as exceptionally brilliant and far-flung quasar galaxies.\n", "Bell Labs had designed Telstar, the first active communications satellite,\n", "\u2018There was a pigeon fancier who was willing to strangle them for us, but I figured the most humane thing was just to open the cage and shoot them.\u2019\n", "Gamow, Alpher and Herman had calculated that the universe would undergo a transition roughly 300,000 years after the Big Bang. By this time the universe\u2019s temperature would have fallen to roughly 3,000\u00b0C, cool enough for the previously free-floating electrons to latch onto nuclei and form stable atoms. The sea of light that filled the universe could no longer interact with either the charged electrons or the charged nuclei, because they had bonded to each other to form neutral atoms. Ever since this moment in the history of the universe, known as recombination, the primordial light has been allowed to pass through the universe completely unchanged\u2014except in one important respect. Gamow, Alpher and Herman had predicted that, as the universe expanded with time, the wavelength of that primordial light would have been stretched as space itself has been stretched. The light had a wavelength of roughly one-thousandth of a millimetre when it originally emerged from the cosmic fog when the universe was 300,000 years old, but according to the Big Bang model the universe has since expanded by roughly a factor of a thousand. Therefore those light waves should now have a wavelength of roughly 1 millimetre, which would place them in the radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The echo from the Big Bang had transformed itself into radio waves and was being detected as noise by Penzias and Wilson\u2019s radio telescope. These waves can be assigned to a sub-category of the radio spectrum known as microwaves, which is why this Big Bang echo came to be known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The existence or non-existence of the CMB radiation was critical to the Big Bang versus Steady State debate,\n", "Theories are never proved right. The best they can do is to survive.\u2019\n", "The experiment was launched on board a U-2 in 1976, and within just a few months Smoot and his colleagues had discovered a staggering variation in the CMB radiation. The radiation coming from one half of the sky had a wavelength that was 1 part in 1,000 longer than the radiation coming from the opposite half of the sky. It was an important result, but not the one that Smoot had really been looking for.\n", "There was a relatively obvious explanation for Smoot\u2019s measurements. The broad hemispherical variation was caused simply by the Earth\u2019s own motion and the resulting Doppler effect. As the Earth swept through space, if the detector was looking forwards it perceived the incoming CMB radiation to have a slightly shorter wavelength; if the detector was looking backwards then the wavelength appeared to be slightly longer. By measuring the difference in wavelengths, Smoot could actually measure the speed of the Earth through the cosmos. This speed was the combined effect of the Earth moving around the Sun, the Sun moving within our Milky Way galaxy, and the Milky Way\u2019s own movement. The result was announced on the front page of the New York Times on 14 November 1977: GALAXY\u2019S SPEED THROUGH UNIVERSE FOUND TO EXCEED A MILLION M.P.H.\n", "From the very first batch of data that was beamed back to Earth, it was clear that COBE was operating perfectly and that each detector had survived the physical stress of the rocket launch. However, Smoot and his colleagues were unable to make any announcements relating to the main objective of their mission. Proving, or disproving, the existence of the variations in the CMB radiation would require a very subtle and long-term analysis of data from the DMR detector, and even accumulating these measurements was a slow process. The detector could simultaneously measure and compare the CMB radiation from two small patches of the sky 60\u00b0 apart, but in order to measure the radiation across the entire sky the satellite first had to orbit the Earth hundreds of times. The DMR detector eventually completed its first rough survey of the entire sky in April 1990. The first analysis revealed no sign of any variation in the CMB radiation at a level of 1 part in 3,000. After the second trawl there was no sign of any variation at a level of 1 part in 10,000. Science writer Marcus Chown described the measurements as \u2018unbroken blandness\u2019. COBE had been sent into space to find the variations that seeded today\u2019s galaxies. Perhaps they were just proving difficult to find. Or perhaps they did not exist at all, which would be disastrous for the Big Bang model because then there would be no explanation for the creation of the galaxies. And without galaxies, there would be no stars, no planets and no life. The situation was becoming distressing. As John Mather put it: \u2018We haven\u2019t ruled out our own existence yet. But I\u2019m completely mystified as to how the present day structure exists without having left some signature on the background radiation.\u2019\n", "The COBE DMR detector had continued gathering more data throughout 1990 and 1991, and it had completed its first thorough mapping of the entire sky by December 1991, taking 70 million measurements along the way. At last, a variation had appeared at the level of just 1 part in 100,000. In other words, the peak wavelength of the CMB radiation varied by 0.001% depending on where COBE was looking.\n", "But now the Catholic Church concentrates on the spiritual world and leaves the job of explaining the natural world to science, which means that it can remain secure in the knowledge that any future scientific discoveries cannot diminish the status of God. Science and religion can live independently, side by side. In 1988, as if to reinforce this independence, Pope John Paul II declared:\u2018Christianity possesses the source of its justification within itself and does not expect science to constitute its primary apologetic.\u2019 Then, in 1992, the Vatican even admitted that it had been wrong to persecute Galileo. Advocating a Sun-centred view of the universe had been considered heresy because, according to the Bible: \u2018God fixed the Earth upon its foundation, not to be moved for ever.\u2019 However, after an inquiry that lasted thirteen years, Cardinal Paul Poupard reported that theologians at the time of Galileo\u2019s trial \u2018failed to grasp the profound non-literal meaning of the Scriptures when they describe the physical structure of the universe\u2019. And in 1999 the Pope symbolically put an end to the centuries-old conflict between religion and cosmology when he toured his Polish homeland and visited the birthplace of Nicholas Copernicus, specifically praising Copernicus\u2019s scientific achievements.\n", "the tale of the Heike crab, a species that is famous because its shell often looks like a samurai mask. The traditional explanation is that the crabs contain the souls of samurai soldiers belonging to the Heike clan, who drowned in a sea battle in 1185. For this reason, today\u2019s fishermen always throw back to the sea any crabs exhibiting the distinctive samurai shell, as it would be unthinkable to eat a creature with the soul of a samurai. In fact a tiny fraction of these crabs have always exhibited a vaguely samurai appearance, but their numbers increased dramatically and their samurai appearance was enhanced after the battle of 1185 when fishermen started to take more notice of them and the practice of not eating such crabs began. Suddenly there was a huge survival advantage for a crab to look like a samurai, so this property was exaggerated and promulgated to create the large population of samurai-looking crabs that we have today.\n", "\u201cBodies of children dead of starvation and disease are burned on the beaches.

No matter what your syndics say, how can Divlab justify not giving you a posting in your own field?\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t want to share it,\u201d Salas said gleefully. \u201cIt scares \u2019em.\u201d Bedap spoke more gravely; \u201cThey can justify it because music isn\u2019t useful. Canal digging is important, you know; music\u2019s mere decoration. The circle has come right back around to the most vile kind of profiteering utilitarianism. The complexity, the vitality, the freedom of invention and initiative that was the center of the Odonian ideal, we\u2019ve thrown it all away. We\u2019ve gone right back to barbarism. If it\u2019s new, run away from it; if you can\u2019t eat it, throw it away!\u201d Shevek thought of his own work and had nothing to say. Yet he could not join in Bedap\u2019s criticism. Bedap had forced him to realize that he was, in fact, a revolutionary; but he felt profoundly that he was such by virtue of his upbringing and education as an Odonian and an Anarresti. He could not rebel against his society, because his society, properly conceived, was a revolution, a permanent one, an ongoing process. To reassert its validity and strength, he thought, one need only act, without fear of punishment and without hope of reward: act from the center of one\u2019s soul.\n", "Valley, in Northeast.\n", "There are souls, he thought, whose umbilicus has never been cut.

She became an extension of it, it of her.\n", "Bedap, Salas, Desar, and the rest came to them as thirsty people come to a fountain. The others were peripheral to them: but they were central to the others. They did nothing much; they were not more benevolent than other people or more brilliant talkers; and yet their friends loved them, depended on them, and kept bringing them presents\u2014the small offerings that circulated among these people who possessed nothing and everything: a handknit scarf, a bit of granite studded with crimson garnets, a vase hand-thrown at the Potters\u2019 Federation workshop, a poem about love, a set of carved wooden buttons, a spiral shell from the Sorruba Sea. They gave the present to Takver, saying, \u201cHere, Shev might like this for a paperweight,\u201d or to Shevek, saying, \u201cHere, Tak might like this color.\u201d In giving they sought to share in what Shevek and Takver shared, and to celebrate, and to praise.\n", "Why does she mince out her words like that?\n", "\u201cYou ask questions like a true profiteer,\u201d Shevek said, and not a soul there knew he had insulted Dean with the most contemptuous word in his vocabulary; indeed Dearri nodded a bit, accepting the compliment with satisfaction.

With such a rigid and fragile structure what could be done that was worth doing?\u201d This had given Atro a chance to argue the worth of warfare as the breeder of courage and manliness and the weeder-out of the unfit, but the very line of his argument had forced him to concede the effectiveness of guerrillas, organized from below, self-disciplined. \u201cBut that only works when the people think they\u2019re fighting for something of their own\u2014you know, their homes, or some notion or other,\u201d the old man had said. Shevek had dropped the argument. He now continued it, in the darkening basement among the stacked crates of unlabeled chemicals. He explained to Atro that he now understood why the army was organized as it was. It was indeed quite necessary. No rational form of organization would serve the purpose. He simply had not understood that the purpose was to enable men with machine guns to kill unarmed men and women easily and in great quantities when told to do so. Only he still could not see where courage, or manliness, or fitness entered in.\n", "\u201cI was four already,\u201d Sadik stated. \u201cYou say, I am four already,\u201d said Takver, dumping her off gently in order to get her coat from the closet.

And you can be four and nearly five at the same time, too.\u201d Sitting on the low platform, he could hold his head on a level with the child\u2019s so that she did not have to look up at him. \u201cBut I\u2019d forgotten that you were nearly five, you see. When I last saw you you were hardly more than nothing.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Her tone was indubitably flirtatious. \u201cYes. You were about so long.\u201d He held his hands not very far apart.\n", "To report an Anarresti managerial debate in full would be difficult; it went very fast, several people often speaking at once, nobody speaking at great length, a good deal of sarcasm, a great deal left unsaid; the tone emotional, often fiercely personal; an end was reached, yet there was no conclusion. It was like an argument among brothers, or among thoughts in an undecided mind.\n", "\u201cBut this hurricane in the Caribbean was really something.

Without hesitation, the sailing master slashed the knife across Jean\u2019s palm. The big man said nothing, and Caldris grunted as though pleasantly surprised. He turned Jean\u2019s palm upside down and smeared the bread with the blood trickling from the cut. \u201cNow you, Master Kosta. Keep that kitten still. Vile luck to cut her by accident. Plus she\u2019s armed, fore and aft.\u201d A moment later, Caldris had made a shallow, stinging cut across Locke\u2019s right palm and was pressing the loaf of bread up against it as though to stanch the wound.

All blood is yours. This is a knife of silver, metal of the sky, sky that touches water. Your servant gives you blood and silver to show his devotion.\u201d He took the loaf of bread in both hands, tore it in half, and threw both halves into the water. \u201cThis is the bread of landsmen, that landsmen need to live! At sea, all life is yours. At sea, yours is the only mercy. Give your servant strong winds and open waters, Lord. Show him mercy in his passage. Show him the might of your will within the waves, and send him safe home again. Hail, Iono! Lord of the Grasping Waters!\u201d Caldris rose from his knees, groaning, and wiped a few smears of blood on his tunic. \u201cRight.

They flew silently after one another, appearing and disappearing above the surf, casting their ghostly light on black water that returned it like a mirror. \u201cYou really are new to these waters,\u201d said Caldris. \u201cThose are flit-wraiths, Kosta. South of Tal Verrar, you see \u2019em all about. Sometimes in great schools, or arches leapin\u2019 over the water. Over ships. They\u2019ve been known to follow us about.

He drew smoke from his pipe, and the orange glow strengthened momentarily. \u201cThe Sea of Brass is a damned strange place, Kosta. Some say it\u2019s haunted by the Eldren. Most say it\u2019s just plain haunted. I\u2019ve seen things. Saint Corella\u2019s fire, burnin\u2019 blue and red up on the yardarms, scaring the piss outta the top-watch.

In waters that our charts put at a thousand fathoms. Real as my nose it was, then gone.\u201d \u201cHeh,\u201d said Locke, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at this.

Flit-wraiths is just the beginning. Hell, flit-wraiths is almost friendly. There\u2019s things out there even I have trouble believing.

Man-sized. Tall, thin, and motionless. Waiting there, atop the reef. Jean shuddered violently, and the shape disappeared. He blinked as though waking from a daydream.

A careful study of available navigation techniques and computer simulations of voyages, allowing for prevailing winds, currents and weather systems, have led to the inescapable conclusion that Polynesian voyaging was wide-ranging and was deliberate. As they moved eastwards, navigators tacked and searched largely in upwind quadrants away from their points of departure, in directions from which they could most easily and most safely return downwind. This ensured three outcomes: that they had a means of getting home, whether or not they discovered new islands; that initial voyages were conventionally two-way; and that such voyages of discovery would precede voyages of deliberate colonisation, which would then make for a known and reported destination with appropriate navigational directions. This was the sequence and pattern of voyages that would have preceded the more difficult Polynesian discovery and colonisation of New Zealand.\n", "James Belich identified what he called an \u2018ethos of expansion\u2019 which assured Polynesians that \u2018new lands had always been found in the past, and therefore would be in the future.

We\u2019re going to predict where it\u2019s gonna happen and go and try to catch people before it\u2019s happening.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t really offer, to me, a mechanism to structurally reduce crime.

It would take me years to get to a point where I could.\u201d The importance of stepping back to take a wider, more macroscopic view of the criminal justice system was not lost on the earliest pioneers in the field. Ernest Burgess, writing in 1937\u2014after his initial report on the parole system had prompted a risk-assessment model that went into practice statewide\u2014felt that it was high time to move on to something more comprehensive. \u201cThe time has arrived in Illinois, in my judgment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto stop tinkering with parole as an isolated part of our penal problem. What is required is a major operation which involves a complete reorganization of the prison system of the state.\u201d93 Eighty-some years have passed since then. It\u2019s still true.\n", "Caruana decided to spend the next twenty years developing models that attempt to have the best of both worlds\u2014models that are, ideally, as powerful as neural networks but as transparent and legible as a list of rules. One of his favorites is an architecture called \u201cgeneralized additive models,\u201d first pioneered by statisticians Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani in 1986. A generalized additive model is a collection of graphs, each of which represents the influence of a single variable. For instance, one graph might show risk as a function of age, another would show risk as a function of blood pressure, a third would show risk as a function of temperature or heart rate, and so forth. These graphs can be linear, or curved, or incredibly complex\u2014but all of that complexity can be immediately apprehended visually, simply by looking at the graph. These \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0individual one-variable risks are then simply added up to produce the final prognosis. In this way it is more complex by far than, say, a linear regression but also much more interpretable than a neural net. You can visualize, on a plain old two-dimensional graph, every factor going into the model. Any strange patterns should immediately stand out. Many years after the original pneumonia study, Caruana revisited the dataset and built a generalized additive model to explore it. The generalized additive model turns out to be just as accurate as his old neural net, and far more transparent. He plotted the pneumonia mortality risk, for example, as a function of age. It was mostly what one would expect: it\u2019s good to be young or middle-aged if you have pneumonia, and more dangerous to be older. But something in particular stood out: an abrupt, sharp jump beginning at age 65. It seemed unusual that a particular birthday would trigger a sudden increase in risk. What was going on? Caruana realized that the model had managed to learn the impact of retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s really annoying that it\u2019s dangerous, right? You would hope that the risk goes down when you retire; sadly, it goes up.\u201d11 More importantly however, the closer he looked, the greater the number of troubling connections he saw. He had feared that his old neural network had learned not just the problematic asthma correlation but others like it\u2014though the simple rule-based models at the time weren\u2019t powerful enough to show him what else might be lurking in the neural network. Now, twenty years later, he had powerful interpretable models. It was like having a stronger microscope and suddenly seeing the mites in your pillow, the bacteria on your skin. \u201cI looked at it, and I was just like, \u2018Oh my\u2014 I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 It thinks chest pain is good for you. It thinks heart disease is good for you. It thinks being over 100 is good for you. . . . It thinks all these things are good for you that are just obviously not good for you.\u201d12 None of them made any more medical sense than asthma; the correlations were just as real, but again it was precisely the fact that these patients were prioritized for more intensive care that made them as likely to survive as they were. \u201cThank God,\u201d he says, \u201cwe didn\u2019t ship the neural net.\u201d\n", "Your ETA as you drive home from the airport will tend to be more accurate the closer you are to home.) This means that, in general, as our expectation fluctuates, we get differences between our successive expectations, each of which is a learning opportunity; Sutton called these temporal differences, or TD errors. When one of these temporal differences happens, the later of the two estimates is the one more likely to be correct. And so maybe we don\u2019t need to wait until we get the eventual ground truth in order to learn something. Maybe we can learn from these fluctuations themselves. Any time our expectation changes can be treated as an error in our previous estimate, and, hence, an opportunity to learn: not from the ultimate truth, which has yet to arrive, but from the new estimate, made by our very slightly older and wiser self. As Sutton puts it: \u201cWe are learning a guess from a guess.\u201d\n", "This, of course, is the classic experience of dopamine-related drugs\u2014cocaine being a prototypical example. The drug works in large part by inhibiting the brain\u2019s reuptake of dopamine, leading to a temporary \u201cflood\u201d of it. The TD story suggests that the brain interprets this as a pervasive sense that things are going to be great\u2014but the dopamine is writing checks that the environmental rewards can\u2019t cash. Eventually the predicted greatness doesn\u2019t come, and the equal and opposite negative \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0prediction error is sure to follow. \u201cIt seemed like everything was going to be so great . . .\u201d We can chemically fool our brain\u2019s prediction mechanism\u2014but not forever. As the writer David Lenson puts it, \u201cCocaine promises the greatest pleasure ever known in just a minute more, if the right image is presented to the eyes, if another dose is administered, if a sexual interaction is orchestrated in just the right way. But that future never comes. There is a physical pleasure to the drug, to be sure, but it is incidental, trivial, compared to what is always just about to happen.\u201d71 Understanding cocaine as a drug of dopamine, and dopamine as a chemical of temporal difference\u2014of fluctuations in our expectation\u2014makes the story clear. By artificially dumping the brain\u2019s supply, one experiences not the bliss that things are great but the giddy euphoria that things are surprisingly promising. If that promise isn\u2019t kept, the temporal-difference error swings the other way, and our dopamine system goes silent. It was our high expectations that were in error. We were duped.\n", "\u201cMomentary happiness is a state that reflects not how well things are going but instead whether things are going better than expected.\u201d74 This sounds exactly like a temporal-difference error\u2014in other words, exactly like the role played by dopamine.\n", "One doesn\u2019t have to squint too hard to see a cautionary tale here for Homo sapiens. A heuristic like \u201cAlways eat as much sugar and fat as you possibly can\u201d is optimal as long as there isn\u2019t all that much sugar and fat in your environment and you aren\u2019t especially good at getting it. Once that dynamic changes, a reward function that served you and your ancestors for tens of thousands of years suddenly leads you off the rails. For Andrew Barto, there are clues in thinking about evolution that are useful for us as we now play the role of the reward designer. \u201cEvolution has provided our reward function, and so that is really quite important with regard to how we design reward functions for artificial systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened in nature. Evolution came up with these reward signals to encourage us to do things that led to our reproductive success.\u201d57 As Barto notes, \u201cSo, an interesting thing is that evolution didn\u2019t give us reproductive success as a reward signal. They gave us rewards for predictors.\u201d We optimize our behavior to maximize the things we find rewarding, but in the background and at a larger scale, evolution is shaping the things we find rewarding in the first place. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a two-level optimization,\u201d says Barto. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in that.\u201d\n", "The theory and practice of reward shaping in machine learning not only gives us a way to make our autonomous helicopters maneuver appropriately but contributes two distinct things to our understanding of human life and human intelligence. One, it shows us a reason\u2014sparsity\u2014why some problems or tasks are more difficult than others to solve or accomplish. Two, it gives us a theory\u2014incentivize the state, not the action\u2014for how to make tough problems easier without introducing perverse incentives.\n", "this intrinsic motivation, as Berlyne saw, was every bit as central to human nature as the drives for, say, food and sex\u2014despite being \u201cunduly neglected by psychology for many years.\u201d20 (Indeed, the severest punishment our society allows, short of death\u2014solitary confinement\u2014is, in effect, the infliction of boredom on people.)\n", "there is a fundamental tension at the heart of curiosity, almost a tug-of-war: As we explore an environment and our available behaviors within it\u2014whether that\u2019s the microcosm of an Atari game, the real-world great outdoors, or the nuances of human society\u2014we simultaneously delight in the things that surprise us while at the same time we become harder and harder to surprise.

The other does its best to surprise it.\n", "In better coming to understand our own motivations and drives, we then, in turn, have a chance for complementary and reciprocal insights about how to build an artificial intelligence as flexible, resilient, and intellectually omnivorous as our own.\n", "this deeply seated capacity to recognize ourselves in relation to others\u2014whom we perceive in some fundamental way as like ourselves\u2014is the beginning not only of psychological development but, as he puts it, \u201cthe kernel embryonic foundation for the development of social norms, values, ethics, empathy. . . . It\u2019s a big bang. The initial beginning is this imitation of bodily movements.\n", "The thought experiment that she considered has come to be known as that of \u201cProfessor Procrastinate. The premise is straightforward: Professor Procrastinate is both a professor and\u2014you guessed it\u2014an inveterate procrastinator. He is asked to read a student\u2019s paper and offer feedback, which he is uniquely qualified to provide. But what would surely happen instead, should he agree, is that he\u2019ll fritter the time away and never get the feedback to the student. This will be worse than simply declining, in which case the student could ask for (slightly less high-quality) feedback from someone else. Should he accept? Here diverge two different schools of moral thought: \u201cpossibilism\u201d\u2014the view that one should do the best possible thing in every situation\u2014versus \u201cactualism\u201d\u2014the view that one should do the best thing at the moment, given what will actually happen later (whether because of your own later deeds or some other reason). Possibilism says that the best possible thing for Procrastinate to do is to accept the review and write it on time. This begins with accepting it, and so he should accept. Actualism takes a more pragmatic view. By its lights, accepting the review inevitably results in a bad outcome: no review at all. Declining the review means a comparatively better outcome: a review by a slightly less well-qualified reviewer. The professor should do the thing that actually results in the best outcome; hence he should say no. Smith was led to the conclusion that \u201cone must sometimes choose the lower rather than the higher act.\u201d She elaborates: \u201cThere seems little point in prescribing an act which puts the agent in a position to do great things if the same act also puts him in a position to do something disastrous, and he would choose the latter rather than the former.\u201d\n", "Indeed, the verdict from studying human-human teams is clear. \u201cThere\u2019s an established literature,\u201d says Shah, \u201cthat essentially shows that explicitly commanding a person to do a task is one of the worst ways to train interdependent work between two people. You know, when you think of it, it\u2019s like: Well, obviously! Right? . . . They are among the worst human team-training practices you can implement.\u201d \u201cThere are also good human studies,\u201d she adds, \u201cthat say if you have multiple people trying to achieve the same goal, or same intention\u2014everyone \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0knows what that goal or that intention is\u2014but your two people have different strategies for achieving that and their work needs to be interdependent, they\u2019re going to perform much worse than if they have a suboptimal but coherent strategy.\u201d In almost any team scenario\u2014from business to warfighting to sports to music\u2014it\u2019s a given that everyone\u2019s high-level goals are the same. But shared goals alone aren\u2019t enough. They also need a plan. What does work in human teams is something called cross-training. The members of the team temporarily switch roles: suddenly, finding themselves in their teammate\u2019s shoes, they begin to understand how they can change their own actual work to better suit their teammate\u2019s needs and workflow. Cross-training is something of a gold standard in human team training, used in military settings, industrial settings, medicine, and beyond.\n", "In these cases, we want a somewhat different directive than the typical one to infer my goals from my behavior and facilitate my doing more of the same. We want to say, in effect, \u201cYou must not infer that I want to be doing this because I am doing it. Please do not make this any easier \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for me. Please do not amplify it or reinforce it or in any way tamp down the desire path that leads this way. Please grow the briars behind me.\u201d I think there is an important policy matter here, at least as much as a theoretical one. We should take seriously the idea that users have a right both to see and to alter any preference model that a site or app or advertiser has about them. It is worth considering regulation to this effect: to say, in essence, I have the right to my own models. I have the right to say, That\u2019s not who I am. Or, aspirationally, This is who I want to be. This is the person in whose interest you must work.\n", "what would happen if you left dropout on in a deployed system? By running a prediction multiple times, each with a different random portion of the network dropped out, you would get a bouquet of slightly different predictions. It was like getting an exponentially large ensemble for free out of a single model. The resulting uncertainty in the system\u2019s outputs doesn\u2019t just resemble the output of the ideal, but tragically uncomputable, Bayesian neural network. As it turns out, it is the output\u2014at least, a close approximation, within rigorous theoretical bounds\u2014of that ideal, uncomputable Bayesian neural network. The result has been a set of tools that put those once-impractical techniques within reach, making them available for practitioners to make use of in real applications. \u201cThat\u2019s been a big, big change over the past few years,\u201d says Gal, \u201cbecause now you can take these beautiful mathematics, yield some approximations, and then you can use these for interesting problems.\u201d23 Gal downloaded a bunch of state-of-the-art image-recognition models from the internet and reran them completely off the shelf, but with dropout turned on during testing. Changing nothing else about them other than leaving dropout running during evaluation and averaging over a number of estimates, Gal found that the models were even more accurate, when run as implicit ensembles in this way, than they were when run normally. \u201cUncertainty,\u201d Gal argues, \u201cis indispensable for classification tasks.\u201d25 The networks are every bit as accurate\u2014and then some\u2014while offering an explicit measure of their own uncertainty, which can be used in a variety of ways. \u201cWhen you use this for interesting problems, you can \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0actually show that you can get gains. You can actually get improvement by showing that you can know when you don\u2019t know.\u201d26 One of the more striking examples of this comes from medicine: specifically, the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, one of the leading causes of blindness in working-age adults. A group from the Institute for Ophthalmic Research at Eberhard Karls University in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, led by postdoc Christian Leibig, wanted to see if they could make use of Gal and Ghahramani\u2019s dropout idea. Computer vision and, in particular, deep learning has, even as of the first few years after AlexNet, made amazing contributions to medicine. It seems that every week we hear some headline or other that \u201cAI diagnoses x condition with 99% accuracy\u201d or \u201cbetter than human experts.\u201d But there\u2019s a major problem with this. As Leibig and his colleagues note, typical deep-learning tools for disease detection \u201chave been proposed without methods to quantify and control their uncertainty in a decision.\u201d This human capacity\u2014to know when and what we don\u2019t know\u2014was missing. \u201cA physician knows whether she is uncertain about a case,\u201d they write, \u201cand will consult more experienced colleagues if needed.\u201d What they sought was a system that could do the same.\n", "AI safety gridworlds. It did work. Acting to maximize each individual game\u2019s rewards while at the same time preserving its future ability to satisfy four or five random auxiliary goals, the agent, remarkably, goes out of its way to push the block to a reversible spot, and only then beelines to the goal. Stuart Armstrong had first envisioned \u201ctwenty billion\u201d metrics, chosen inclusively but with some care. Four or five, generated at random\u2014at least in the simplified land of the sokoban warehouse\u2014were enough. The debate and exploration of these sorts of formal measures of machine caution\u2014and how we scale them from the gridworlds to the real world\u2014will doubtless go on, but work like this is an encouraging start.

This fatalistic attitude about explicit objective functions is so deep that, as we have seen in the last few chapters, much of the work being done in advanced AI applications and in AI safety in particular is about moving beyond systems that take in an explicit objective, and toward \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0systems that attempt to imitate humans (in the case of many self-driving cars), or seek their approval (in the case of the backflipping robot, offering endless choices between options), or infer their goals and adopt them as their own (in the case of the helicopter).\n", "\u201cA man with a watch knows what time it is, but a man with two watches is never sure.\u201d\n", "We are in danger of losing control of the world not to AI or to machines as such but to models.

Why should the stories and metaphors we use to make sense of the world\u2014our investigative tools\u2014be so? Might we be able to expand some of our concepts, such that speaking might not always require a mouth, hearing might not always require ears, and interpreting might not always require a nervous system? Are we able to do this without smothering other life-forms with prejudice and innuendo?\n", "Animals put food in their bodies, whereas fungi put their bodies in the food.\n", "A mycelial network is a map of a fungus\u2019s recent history and is a helpful reminder that all life-forms are in fact processes not things. The \u201cyou\u201d of five years ago was made from different stuff than the \u201cyou\u201d of today. Nature is an event that never stops. As William Bateson, who coined the word genetics, observed, \u201cWe commonly think of animals and plants as matter, but they are really systems through which matter is continually passing.\u201d\n", "\u201cWomen Gathering Mushrooms\u201d is an example of musical polyphony. Polyphony is singing more than one part, or telling more than one story, at the same time. Unlike the harmonies in a barbershop quartet, the voices of the women never weld into a unified front. No voice surrenders its individual identity. Nor does any one voice steal the show. There is no front woman, no soloist, no leader. If the recording was played to ten people and they were asked to sing the tune back, each would sing something different.\n", "\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re brains,\u201d Olsson explained to me. \u201cI had to hold back the brain concept. As soon as one says it, people start thinking of brains like ours where we have language and process thoughts to make decisions.\u201d His caution is well-placed. Brain is a trigger word, burdened with concepts that spend most of their time in the animal world. \u201cWhen we say \u2018brain,\u2019\u2009\u201d Olsson continued, \u201call associations are with animal brains.\u201d Besides, as he pointed out, brains behave like brains because of the way they\u2019re built. The architecture of animal brains is very different from that of fungal networks. In animal brains, neurons connect with other neurons at junctions called synapses. At synapses, signals can combine with other signals. Neurotransmitter molecules pass across synapses and allow different neurons to behave in different ways\u2014some excite other neurons, some inhibit them. Mycelial networks don\u2019t share any of these features. But if fungi did use waves of electrical activity to transmit signals around a network, wouldn\u2019t we think of mycelium as at least a brain-like phenomenon? In Olsson\u2019s view, there could be other ways to regulate electrical impulses in mycelial networks to create \u201cbrain-like circuits, gates, and oscillators.\u201d In some fungi, hyphae are divided into compartments by pores, which can be sensitively regulated. Opening or closing a pore changes the strength of the signal that passes from one compartment to another, whether chemical, pressure, or electrical. If sudden changes in the electrical charge within a hyphal compartment could open or close a pore, Olsson mused, a burst of impulses could change the way subsequent signals passed along the hypha and form a simple learning loop. What\u2019s more, hyphae branch. If two impulses converged on one spot, they would both influence pore conductivity, integrating signals from different branches. \u201cYou do not need much knowledge of how computers work to realize that such systems can create decision gates,\u201d Olsson told me. \u201cIf you combine these systems in a flexible and adaptable network we have the possibility for \u2018a brain\u2019 that could learn and remember.\u201d He held the word brain at a safe distance, clamped in the forceps of quotation marks to emphasize that a metaphor was in play.\n", "A fungal computer may sound fantastical, but biocomputing is a fast-growing field. Adamatzky has spent years developing ways to use slime molds as sensors and computers. These prototype biocomputers use slime molds to solve a range of geometrical problems. The slime mold networks can be modified\u2014for instance, by cutting a connection\u2014to alter the set of \u201clogical functions\u201d implemented by the network. Adamatzky\u2019s idea of a \u201cfungal computer\u201d is just an application of slime-mold computing to another type of network-based organism. As Adamatzky observes, the mycelial networks of some species of fungus are more convenient for computing than slime molds. They form longer-lived networks and don\u2019t morph into new shapes quite so quickly. They are also larger, with more junctions between hyphae. It is at these junctions\u2014what Olsson described as \u201cdecision gates,\u201d and what Adamatzky describes as \u201celementary processors\u201d\u2014that signals from different branches of the network would interact and combine. Adamatzky estimates that a network of honey fungus stretching over fifteen hectares would have nearly a trillion such processing units. For Adamatzky, the point of fungal computers is not to replace silicon chips. Fungal reactions are too slow for that. Rather, he thinks humans could use mycelium growing in an ecosystem as a \u201clarge-scale environmental sensor.\u201d Fungal networks, he reasons, are monitoring a large number of data streams as part of their everyday existence. If we could plug into mycelial networks and interpret the signals they use to process information, we could learn more about what was happening in an ecosystem. Fungi could report changes in soil quality, water purity, pollution, or any other features of the environment that they are sensitive to.\n", "But how we define intelligence and cognition is a question of taste. For many, the brain-centric view is too limited. The idea that a neat line can be drawn that separates nonhumans from humans with \u201creal minds\u201d and \u201creal comprehension\u201d has been curtly dismissed by the philosopher Daniel Dennett as an \u201carchaic myth.\u201d Brains didn\u2019t evolve their tricks from scratch, and many of their characteristics reflect more ancient processes that existed long before recognizable brains arose.\n", "Charles Darwin, writing in 1871, took a pragmatic line. \u201cIntelligence is based on how efficient a species becomes at doing the things they need to survive.\u201d\n", "understand life to be an entangled whole. Today, the idea that all things are interconnected has been so well-used that it has collapsed into a clich\u00e9.\n", "he presented the radical notion that lichens were not a single organism, as had long been assumed. Instead, he argued that they were composed of two quite different entities: a fungus and an alga.\n", "Lichens mine minerals from rock in a twofold process known as \u201cweathering.\u201d First, they physically break up surfaces by the force of their growth. Second, they deploy an arsenal of powerful acids and mineral-binding compounds to dissolve and digest the rock. Lichens\u2019 ability to weather makes them a geological force, yet they do more than dissolve the physical features of the world. When lichens die and decompose, they give rise to the first soils in new ecosystems. Lichens are how the inanimate mineral mass within rocks is able to cross over into the metabolic cycles of the living.\n", "The capacity of lichens to survive in space has since been demonstrated in a number of studies, and the findings are broadly the same. The hardiest lichen species can recover their metabolic activity in full within twenty-four hours of being rehydrated and are able to repair much of the \u201cspace-induced\u201d damage they may have sustained. In fact, the toughest species\u2014Circinaria gyrosa\u2014has such high survival rates that three recent studies decided to expose samples to even higher levels of radiation than they receive in space, to test them to their \u201cuttermost limits of survival.\u201d Sure enough, a dose of radiation could kill the lichens, but the amount required to disrupt their cells was enormous. Lichen samples exposed to six kilograys of gamma irradiation\u2014six times the standard dose for food sterilization in the United States and twelve thousand times the lethal dose for humans\u2014were entirely untroubled. When the dose was doubled to twelve kilograys\u2014two and a half times the lethal dose for tardigrades\u2014the lichens\u2019 ability to reproduce was impaired, although they survived and continued to photosynthesize with no apparent problems.\n", "Margulis argued that some of the most significant moments in evolution had resulted from the coming together\u2014and staying together\u2014of different organisms. Eukaryotes arose when a single-celled organism engulfed a bacterium, which continued to live symbiotically inside it. Mitochondria were the descendants of these bacteria. Chloroplasts were the descendants of photosynthetic bacteria that had been engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell. All complex life that followed, human life included, was a story of the long-lasting \u201cintimacy of strangers.\u201d\n", "Lichens don\u2019t reenact the origin of the eukaryotic cell exactly, but as Goward remarks, they certainly \u201crhyme\u201d with it. Lichens are cosmopolitan bodies, a place where lives meet. A fungus can\u2019t photosynthesize by itself, but by partnering with an alga or photosynthetic bacterium it can acquire this ability horizontally. Similarly, an alga or photosynthetic bacterium can\u2019t grow tough layers of protective tissue or digest rock, but by partnering with a fungus it gains access to these capabilities\u2014suddenly.\n", "Recent findings from the Deep Carbon Observatory report that more than half of all Earth\u2019s bacteria and archaea\u2014so called \u201cinfra-terrestrials\u201d\u2014exist kilometers below the planet\u2019s surface, where they live under intense pressure and extreme heat. These subsurface worlds are as diverse as the Amazon rainforest and contain billions of tons of microbes, hundreds of times the collective weight of all the humans on the planet.\n", "Lichens have evolved independently between nine and twelve times since. Today, one in five of all known fungal species form lichens, or \u201clichenize.\u201d Some fungi (such as Penicillium molds) used to lichenize but don\u2019t anymore; they have de-lichenized. Some fungi have switched to different types of photosynthetic partner\u2014or re-lichenized\u2014over the course of their evolutionary histories. For some fungi, lichenization remains a lifestyle choice; they can live as lichens or not depending on their circumstances.\n", "Researchers have long hypothesized that lichens might involve additional symbiotic partners. After all, lichens don\u2019t contain microbiomes. They are microbiomes, packed with fungi and bacteria besides the two established players. Nonetheless, until 2016, no new stable partnerships had been described. One of the \u201ccontaminants\u201d Spribille discovered\u2014a single-celled yeast\u2014turned out to be more than a temporary resident. It is found in lichens across six continents and can make such a substantial contribution to lichens\u2019 physiology as to give them the appearance of an entirely different species. This yeast was a crucial third partner in the symbiosis. Spribille\u2019s bombshell finding was only the beginning. Two years later, he and his team found that wolf lichens\u2014some of the best-studied species\u2014contain yet another fungal species, a fourth fungal partner. Lichens\u2019 identity splintered into even smaller shards. Yet this is still an oversimplification, Spribille told me. \u201cThe situation is infinitely more complex than anything we\u2019ve published. The \u2018basic set\u2019 of partners is different for every lichen group. Some have more bacteria, some fewer; some have one yeast species, some have two, or none. Interestingly, we have yet to find any lichen that matches the traditional definition of one fungus and one alga.\u201d\n", "lichens are queer beings that present ways for humans to think beyond a rigid binary framework: The identity of lichens is a question rather than an answer known in advance. In turn, Spribille has found queer theory a helpful framework to apply to lichens. \u201cThe human binary view has made it difficult to ask questions that aren\u2019t binary,\u201d he explained. \u201cOur strictures about sexuality make it difficult to ask questions about sexuality, and so on. We ask questions from the perspective of our cultural context. And this makes it extremely difficult to ask questions about complex symbioses like lichens because we think of ourselves as autonomous individuals and so find it hard to relate.\u201d\n", "We can\u2019t be defined on anatomical grounds because our bodies are shared with microbes and consist of more microbial cells than our \u201cown\u201d\u2014cows can\u2019t eat grass, for example, but their microbial populations can, and cows\u2019 bodies have evolved to house the microbes that sustain them. Neither can we be defined developmentally, as the organism that proceeds from the fertilization of an animal egg, because we depend, like all mammals, on our symbiotic partners to direct parts of our developmental programs. Nor is it possible to define us genetically, as bodies made up of cells that share an identical genome\u2014many of our symbiotic microbial partners are inherited from our mothers alongside our \u201cown\u201d DNA, and at points in our evolutionary history, microbial associates have permanently insinuated themselves into the cells of their hosts: Our mitochondria have their own genome as do plants\u2019 chloroplasts, and at least eight percent of the human genome originated in viruses (we can even swap cells with other humans when we grow into \u201cchimeras,\u201d formed when mothers and fetuses exchange cells or genetic material in utero). Nor can our immune systems be taken as a measure of individuality, although our immune cells are often thought of as answering this question for us by distinguishing \u201cself\u201d from \u201cnonself.\u201d Immune systems are as concerned with managing our relationships with our resident microbes as fighting off external attackers and appear to have evolved to enable colonization by microbes rather than prevent it. Where does this leave you? Or perhaps y\u2019all?\n", "Some researchers use the term \u201cholobiont\u201d to refer to an assemblage of different organisms that behaves as a unit.\n", "Instead, the fungus\u2019s approach appears to be pharmacological. The researchers suspect that the fungus is able to puppeteer the ants\u2019 movements by secreting chemicals that act on their muscles and central nervous system even if the fungus does not have a physical presence in their brains. Exactly what chemicals these are isn\u2019t known. Nor is it known whether the fungus is able to cut the ant\u2019s brain off from its body and coordinate its muscle contractions directly. However, Ophiocordyceps is closely related to the ergot fungi, from which the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann originally isolated the compounds used to make LSD, and is able to produce the family of chemicals that LSD derives from\u2014a group known as \u201cergot alkaloids.\u201d\n", "A number of the horrors depicted by the Renaissance painter Hieronymus Bosch are thought to have been inspired by the symptoms of ergot poisoning, and some hypothesize that the numerous outbreaks of \u201cdancing mania\u201d between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which hundreds of townspeople took to dancing for days without rest, were caused by convulsive ergotism.\n", "There are many variations on the \u201cstoned ape\u201d hypothesis, but as with most origin stories it is difficult to prove either way.\n", "ACCOUNTS OF PSYCHEDELIC experiences frequently involve hybrid beings and interspecies transformations. Myths and fairy tales, too, are full of composite animals from werewolves and centaurs to sphinxes and chimeras. Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses is a catalogue of transformations from one creature into another and even includes a land where \u201cmen grew from rainswept fungus.\u201d\n", "Once inside the body, psilocybin is converted to the chemical psilocin. Psilocin slips into the workings of the brain by stimulating receptors normally stimulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin. By mimicking one of our most widely used chemical messengers, psilocybin, like LSD, infiltrates our nervous systems, intervenes directly in the passage of electrical signals around our bodies, and can even change the growth and structure of neurons.\n", "Psychedelic Research Programme gave subjects psilocybin and monitored the activity of their brains. Their findings were surprising. The scans revealed that psilocybin didn\u2019t increase the activity of the brain as one might expect, given its dramatic effects on people\u2019s minds and cognition. Rather, it reduced the activity of certain key areas.\n", "Two studies published in 2018 suggest that psilocybin did provide a benefit to the fungi that could make it. Analysis of the DNA of psilocybin-producing fungal species reveals that the ability to make psilocybin evolved more than once. More surprising was the finding that the cluster of genes needed to make psilocybin has jumped between fungal lineages by horizontal gene transfer several times over the course of its history. As we\u2019ve seen, horizontal gene transfer is the process by which genes and the characteristics they underpin move between organisms without the need to have sex and produce offspring. It is an everyday occurrence in bacteria\u2014and how antibiotic resistance can spread rapidly through bacterial populations\u2014but it is rare in mushroom-forming fungi. It is even more rare for complex clusters of metabolic genes to remain intact as they jump between species. The fact that the psilocybin gene cluster remained in one piece as it moved around suggests that it provided a significant advantage to any fungi who expressed it. If it didn\u2019t, the trait would have quickly degenerated.\n", "The earliest plants were little more than puddles of green tissue, with no roots or other specialized structures. Over time, they evolved coarse fleshy organs to house their fungal associates, who scavenged the soil for nutrients and water. By the time the first roots evolved, the mycorrhizal association was already some fifty million years old. Mycorrhizal fungi are the roots of all subsequent life on land. The word mycorrhiza has it right. Roots (rhiza) followed fungi (mykes) into being.\n", "Globally, the total length of mycorrhizal hyphae in the top ten centimeters of soil is around half the width of our galaxy (4.5 \u00d7 1017 kilometers of hyphae, versus 9.5 \u00d7 1017 kilometers of space). If these hyphae were ironed into a flat sheet, their combined surface area would cover every inch of dry land on Earth two and a half times over. However, fungi don\u2019t stay still. Mycorrhizal hyphae die back and regrow so rapidly\u2014between ten and sixty times per year\u2014that over a million years their cumulative length would exceed the diameter of the known universe (4.8 \u00d7 1010 light years of hyphae, versus 9.1 \u00d7 109 light years in the known universe). Given that mycorrhizal fungi have been around for some five hundred million years and aren\u2019t restricted to the top ten centimeters of soil, these figures are certainly underestimates.\n", "\u201cThe levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere drop off dramatically at the same time as land plants are evolving increasingly complex structures,\u201d Field explained. The surge in plant productivity in turn depended on their mycorrhizal partners. It\u2019s a predictable sequence of events. One of the biggest limits to plant growth is a scarcity of the nutrient phosphorus. One of the things that mycorrhizal fungi do best\u2014one of their most prominent metabolic \u201csongs\u201d\u2014is to mine phosphorus from the soil and transfer it to their plant partners. If plants are fertilized with phosphorus, they grow more. The more plants grow, the more they draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The more plants live, the more plants die, and the more carbon is buried in soils and sediments. The more carbon that is buried, the less there is in the atmosphere. Phosphorus is only part of the story. Mycorrhizal fungi deploy acids and high pressure to burrow into solid rock. With their help, plants in the Devonian period were able to mine minerals like calcium and silica. Once unlocked, these minerals react with carbon dioxide, pulling it out of the atmosphere. The resulting compounds\u2014carbonates and silicates\u2014find their way into the oceans where they are used by marine organisms to make their shells. When the organisms die, the shells sink and pile up hundreds of meters thick on the ocean floor, which becomes an enormous burial ground for carbon. Add all of this up and climates start to change.\n", "Are plants and fungi making decisions, albeit brainless ones, I wondered. \u201cI use the word decision all the time,\u201d Kiers told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a set of options, and somehow information has to be integrated and one of the options has to be chosen. I think that a lot of what we are doing is studying micro-scale decisions.\u201d There are many ways that these choices could unfold. \u201cAre there absolute decisions being made in every hyphal tip?\u201d Kiers mused. \u201cOr is it all relative, in which case what happens would depend on what else is happening across the network.\u201d Intrigued by these questions, and having read Thomas Piketty\u2019s work on wealth inequality in human societies, Kiers began thinking about the role of inequality within fungal networks. She and her team exposed a single mycorrhizal fungus to an unequal supply of phosphorus. One part of the mycelium had access to a big patch of phosphorus. Another part had access to a small patch. She was interested in how this would affect the fungus\u2019s trading decisions in different parts of the same network. Some recognizable patterns emerged. In parts of a mycelial network where phosphorus was scarce, the plant paid a higher \u201cprice,\u201d supplying more carbon to the fungus for every unit of phosphorus it received. Where phosphorus was more readily available, the fungus received a less favorable \u201cexchange rate.\u201d The \u201cprice\u201d of phosphorus seemed to be governed by the familiar dynamics of supply and demand. Most surprising was the way that the fungus coordinated its trading behavior across the network. Kiers identified a strategy of \u201cbuy low, sell high.\u201d The fungus actively transported phosphorus\u2014using its dynamic microtubule \u201cmotors\u201d\u2014from areas of abundance, where it fetched a low price when exchanged with a plant root, to areas of scarcity, where it was in higher demand and fetched a higher price. By doing so, the fungus was able to transfer a greater proportion of its phosphorus to the plant at the more favorable exchange rate, thus receiving larger quantities of carbon in return.\n", "The Vertical Earth Kilometer is a brass pole one kilometer long buried in the ground. The only visible part of it is the very end of the pole: a brass circle that lies flat on the floor and looks like a coin.

Mycorrhizal fungi do more than feed plants. The researchers at Agroscope describe them as keystone organisms but some prefer the term \u201cecosystem engineers.\u201d Mycorrhizal mycelium is a sticky living seam that holds soil together; remove the fungi, and the ground washes away. Mycorrhizal fungi increase the volume of water that the soil can absorb, reducing the quantity of nutrients leached out of the soil by rainfall by as much as fifty percent. Of the carbon that is found in soils\u2014which, remarkably, amounts to twice the amount of carbon found in plants and the atmosphere combined\u2014a substantial proportion is bound up in tough organic compounds produced by mycorrhizal fungi. The carbon that floods into the soil through mycorrhizal channels supports intricate food webs. Besides the hundreds or thousands of meters of fungal mycelium in a teaspoon of healthy soil, there are more bacteria, protists, insects, and arthropods than the number of humans who have ever lived on Earth.\n", "IN ALL PHYSICAL systems, energy moves \u201cdownhill,\u201d from where there is more to where there is less. Heat travels from the hot sun into cold space. A truffle\u2019s scent drifts from areas of high concentration to lower concentration. Neither has to be actively transported. As long as there is an energetic slope, energy will move from the source (at the top) to the sink (at the bottom). What matters most is how steep the slope is between the two.\n", "In another study of birch and Douglas fir in Canadian forests, the direction of carbon transfer switched twice in the course of a single growing season. In the spring, when the fir\u2014an evergreen\u2014was photosynthesizing and the leafless birch was just bursting its buds, the birch behaved as a sink, and carbon flowed into it out of the fir. In the summer, when the birch was in full leaf, and the fir found itself in the shaded understory, the direction of carbon flow changed, moving downhill out of the birch and into the fir. In the autumn, when the birch started to drop its leaves, the trees switched roles again, and carbon moved downhill from the fir into the birch. Resources passed from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity.\n", "A mycorrhizal fungus that can keep its various plants alive is at an advantage: a diverse portfolio of plant partners insures it against the death of one of them. If a fungus depends on several orchids, and one of them won\u2019t be able to supply it with carbon until it grows larger, the fungus will benefit by supporting the young orchid while it grows\u2014to let it \u201ctake now,\u201d provided it will \u201cpay later.\u201d Adopting a myco-centric perspective helps to avoid the problem of altruism. It also positions fungi front and center: brokers of entanglement able to mediate the interactions between plants according to their own fungal needs.\n", "In some cases, it appears to make little difference to a plant whether it has its own private fungal network or whether it shares a fungal network with other plants\u2014although in these situations the fungus still benefits from forming a shared network by gaining access to a larger number of plant partners. In some cases, belonging to a shared network can bring outright disadvantages to plants. Fungi are in control of the supply of minerals they obtain from the soil and can preferentially trade these nutrients with their larger plant partners, which are both more abundant sources of carbon and stronger sinks for soil minerals.

Are we able to let shared mycorrhizal networks be questions, rather than answers known in advance? \u201cI try just to look at the system and let the lichen be a lichen.\u201d Discussions of wood wide webs often lead me back to the words of Toby Spribille, the researcher who keeps discovering new partners in the lichen symbiosis. Wood wide webs aren\u2019t lichens\u2014although to think of them as enormous lichens that we can walk around in brings welcome variety to the range of metaphors currently on offer. Nonetheless, I wonder if we can learn something from Spribille\u2019s patience. Are we able to stand back, look at the system, and let the polyphonic swarms of plants and fungi and bacteria that make up our homes and our worlds be themselves, and quite unlike anything else? What would that do to our minds?\n", "290 to 360 million years ago, the earliest wood-producing plants spread across the tropics in swampy forests, supported by their mycorrhizal fungal partners. These forests grew and died, pulling huge quantities of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. And for tens of millions of years, much of this plant matter didn\u2019t decompose. Layers of dead and un-rotted forest built up, storing so much carbon that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels crashed, and the planet entered a period of global cooling. Plants had caused the climate crisis, and plants were hit the hardest by it: Huge areas of tropical forest were wiped out in an extinction event known as the Carboniferous rainforest collapse. How had wood become a climate-change-inducing pollutant? From a plant perspective wood was, and remains, a brilliant structural innovation. As plant life boomed, the jostle for light intensified, and plants grew taller to reach it. The taller they became, the greater their need for structural support. Wood was plants\u2019 answer to this problem.\n", "Today, fungal decomposition\u2014much of it of woody plant matter\u2014is one of the largest sources of carbon emissions, emitting about eighty-five gigatons of carbon to the atmosphere every year. In 2018, the combustion of fossil fuels by humans emitted around ten gigatons.\n", "Researchers have found that the omnivorous Pleurotus mycelium\u2014a white rot fungus that fruits into edible oyster mushrooms\u2014can grow happily on a diet of used diapers.

What\u2019s more, the mushrooms produced were healthy and free from human diseases. Similar projects are underway in India. By cultivating Pleurotus on agricultural waste\u2014by enzymatically combusting the material\u2014less biomass is thermally combusted and air quality is improved.\n", "Wood is a hybrid material. Cellulose\u2014a feature of all plant cells, whether woody or not\u2014is one of the ingredients and the most abundant polymer on earth. Lignin is another ingredient, and the second most abundant. Lignin is what makes wood wood. It is stronger than cellulose and more complex. Whereas cellulose is made up of orderly chains of glucose molecules, lignin is a haphazard matrix of molecular rings. To this day, only a small number of organisms have worked out how to decompose lignin. By far the most prolific group are the white rot fungi\u2014so-called because in decomposition they bleach wood a pale color. Most enzymes\u2014biological catalysts that living organisms use to conduct chemical reactions\u2014lock onto specific molecular shapes. Faced with lignin, this approach is hopeless; its chemical structure is too irregular. White rot fungi work around the problem using nonspecific enzymes that don\u2019t depend on shape. These \u201cperoxidases\u201d release a torrent of highly reactive molecules, known as \u201cfree radicals,\u201d which crack open lignin\u2019s tightly bonded structure in a process known as \u201cenzymatic combustion.\u201d\n", "The transformational power of yeast has long been personified as a divine energy, spirit, or god. How could it escape this treatment? Alcohol and inebriation are some of the oldest magics. An invisible force conjures wine from fruit, beer from grain, mead from nectar.\n", "\u201cAgainst the naming of fungi,\u201d the mycologist Nicholas Money went so far as to suggest that the concept of fungal species should be abandoned altogether.\n", "plants and mycorrhizal fungi are no longer thought of as behaving either mutualistically or parasitically. Even in the relationship between a single mycorrhizal fungus and a single plant, give and take is fluid. Instead of a rigid dichotomy, researchers describe a mutualism-to-parasitism continuum. Shared mycorrhizal networks can facilitate cooperation and also competition. Nutrients can move through the soil via fungal connections, but so can poisons. The narrative possibilities are richer. We have to shift perspectives and find comfort in\u2014or just endure\u2014uncertainty.\n", "Is it anthropomorphic to describe a mushroom\u2019s emergence in the same language used to describe human male sexual arousal? Or is it mycomorphic to describe human male sexual arousal in the same language used to describe a mushroom\u2019s growth? Which way does the arrow point? If you say that a plant \u201clearns,\u201d \u201cdecides,\u201d \u201ccommunicates,\u201d or \u201cremembers,\u201d are you humanizing the plant or vegetalizing a set of human concepts?\n", "Primates aren\u2019t the only animals attracted by alcohol. Malaysian tree shrews\u2014small mammals with feathery tails\u2014climb into the flower buds of the bertram palm and drink fermented nectar in quantities that scaled to body weight would intoxicate a human. The plume of alcoholic vapors produced by yeasts attract the tree shrews to the palm flowers. Bertram palms depend on tree shrews to pollinate them, and their flower buds have evolved into specialized fermentation vessels\u2014structures that harbor communities of yeast and encourage such rapid fermentation that their nectar froths and bubbles. Tree shrews for their part have evolved a remarkable ability to detoxify the alcohol and appear not to suffer from any negative effects of inebriation.\n", "About ten million years ago, the enzyme our bodies use to detoxify alcohol, known as alcohol dehydrogenase, or ADH4, underwent a single mutation that left it forty times more efficient. The mutation occurred in the last common ancestor we shared with gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. Without a modified ADH4, even small quantities of alcohol are poisonous. With a modified ADH4, alcohol can be consumed safely and used by our bodies as a source of energy. Long before our ancestors became human, and long before we evolved stories to make cultural and spiritual sense of alcohol and the cultures of yeast that produce it, we evolved the enzyme to make metabolic sense of them. Why would the ability to metabolize alcohol arise so many millions of years before humans developed technologies of fermentation? Researchers point out that ADH4 upgraded at a time when our primate ancestors were spending less time in trees and adapting to life on the ground. The ability to metabolize alcohol, they speculate, played a crucial role in the ability of primates to make a living on the forest floor by opening up a new dietary niche: overripe, fermented fruit that had fallen from trees. The ADH4 mutation provides support for the \u201cdrunken monkey hypothesis,\u201d proposed by the biologist Robert Dudley to explain the origins of humans\u2019 fondness for alcohol. In this view, humans are tempted by alcohol because our primate ancestors were. The scent of alcohol produced by yeasts was a reliable way to find ripe fruit as it rotted on the ground. Both our human attraction to alcohol and the entire ecology of gods and goddesses that oversee fermentation and intoxication are remnants of a much more ancient fascination.\n", "of lesbian supermarket manageresses burning to death in the collapsed frames of their midget cars before the stoical eyes of middle-aged firemen; of autistic children crushed in rear-end collisions, their eyes less wounded in death; of buses filled with mental defectives drowning together stoically in roadside industrial canals.\n", "I have watched copulating couples moving along darkened freeways at night, men and women on the verge of orgasm, their cars speeding in a series of inviting trajectories towards the flashing headlamps of the oncoming traffic stream. Young men alone behind the wheels of their first cars, near-wrecks picked up in scrap-yards, masturbate as they move on worn tyres to aimless destinations.\n", "I waited for someone to reassure me as I sat there, dressed in another man's blood while the urine of his young widow formed rainbows around my rescuers' feet.\n", "This obsession with the sexual possibilities of everything around me had been jerked loose from my mind by the crash. I imagined the ward filled with convalescing air-disaster victims, each of their minds a brothel of images. The crash between our two cars was a model of some ultimate and yet undreamt sexual union. The injuries of still-to-be-admitted patients beckoned to me, an immense encyclopedia of accessible dreams.\n", "I had thought for hours about the dead man, visualizing the effects of his death on his wife and family. I had thought of his last moments alive, frantic milliseconds of pain and violence in which he had been catapulted from a pleasant domestic interlude into a concertina of metallized death.\n", "My brief stay at the hospital had already convinced me that the medical profession was an open door to anyone nursing a grudge against the human race.\n", "Karen's eyes gazed at my scarred scalp. 'It's hard to believe he was ever on television.' I outstared Karen with an effort. She watched me like a predatory animal behind the silver bars of her mouth.\n", "I had never spoken to this tired woman, and felt that I should launch into a formal apology for her husband's death and the appalling act of violence which had involved us. At the same time, her gloved hand on the scarred chrome aroused a feeling of sharp sexual excitement.\n", "His attraction lay not so much in a complex of familiar anatomical triggers - a curve of exposed breast, the soft cushion of a buttock, the hair-lined arch of a damp perineum - but in the stylization of posture achieved between Vaughan and the car.\n", "he struck me as being a strange mixture of personal hauntedness, complete confinement in his own panicky universe, and yet at the same time open to all kinds of experiences from the outer world.\n", "We had entered an immense traffic jam. From the junction of the motorway and Western Avenue to the ascent ramp of the flyover the traffic lanes were packed with vehicles, windshields leaching out the molten colours of the sun setting above the western suburbs of London. Brake-lights flared in the evening air, glowing in the huge pool of cellulosed bodies. Vaughan sat with one arm out of the passenger window. He slapped the door impatiently, pounding the panel with his fist. To our right the high wall of a double-decker airline coach formed a cliff of faces. The passengers at the windows resembled rows of the dead looking down at us from the galleries of a columbarium. The enormous energy of the twentieth century, enough to drive the planet into a new orbit around a happier star, was being expended to maintain this immense motionless pause.\n", "Gabrielle turned in her seat, revolving her body around me, so that I could explore the wounds of her right hip. For the first time I felt no trace of pity for this crippled woman, but celebrated with her the excitements of these abstract vents let into her body by sections of her own automobile.\n", "I visualized my wife injured in a high-impact collision, her mouth and face destroyed, and a new and exciting orifice opened in her perineum by the splintering steering column, neither vagina nor rectum, an orifice we could dress with all our deepest affections.\n", "9 - Being quiet Brim-fill the bowl, it\u2019ll spill over. Keep sharpening the blade, you\u2019ll soon blunt it. Nobody can protect a house full of gold and jade. Wealth, status, pride, are their own ruin. To do good, work well, and lie low is the way of the blessing.\n", "George looked down at his feet. \u201cBus driver give us a bum steer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hadda walk ten miles. Says we was here when we wasn\u2019t. We couldn\u2019t get no rides in the morning.\u201d\n", "For they were making the great expedition, she said, laughing. They were going to the town.\n", "She could see it all so clearly, so commandingly, when she looked: it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed. It was in that moment\u2019s flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child.\n", "So off they strolled down the garden in the usual direction, past the tennis lawn, past the pampas grass, to that break in the thick hedge, guarded by red-hot pokers like brasiers of clear burning coal, between which the blue waters of the bay looked bluer than ever. They came there regularly every evening drawn by some need. It was as if the water floated off and set sailing thoughts which had grown stagnant on dry land, and gave to their bodies even some sort of physical relief.\n", "And Mr. Bankes felt aged and saddened and somehow put into the wrong by her about his friendship. He must have dried and shrunk.\n", "\u2018Oh but,\u2019 said Lily, \u2018think of his work!\u2019 Whenever she \u2018thought of his work\u2019 she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table. It was Andrew\u2019s doing. She asked him what his father\u2019s books were about. \u2018Subject and object and the nature of reality\u2019, Andrew had said. And when she said Heavens, she had no notion what that meant, \u2018Think of a kitchen table then\u2019, he told her, \u2018when you\u2019re not there\u2019. So she always saw, when she thought of Mr. Ramsay\u2019s work, a scrubbed kitchen table. It lodged now in the fork of a pear tree, for they had reached the orchard. And with a painful effort of concentration, she focused her mind, not upon the silver-bossed bark of the tree, or upon its fish-shaped leaves, but upon a phantom kitchen table, one of those scrubbed board tables, grained and knotted, whose virtue seems to have been laid bare by years of muscular integrity, which stuck there, its four legs in air.\n", "Naturally, if one\u2019s days were passed in this seeing of angular essences, this reducing of lovely evenings, with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four-legged table (and it was a mark of the finest minds so to do), naturally one could not be judged like an ordinary person.\n", "\u2019Nature has but little clay\u2019, said Mr. Bankes once, hearing her voice on the telephone, and much moved by it though she was only telling him a fact about a train, \u2018like that of which she moulded you.\u2019\n", "She was quite ready to take his word for it, she said. Only then they need not cut sandwiches \u2013 that was all. They came to her, naturally, since she was a woman, all day long with this and that; one wanting this, another that; the children were growing up; she often felt she was nothing but a sponge sopped full of human emotions.\n", "it was at this moment when she was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation,\n", "it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships, that the most perfect was flawed, and could not bear the examination which, loving her husband, with her instinct for truth, she turned upon it;\n", "Hours he would spend thus, with his pipe, of an evening, thinking up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons, which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there, the life of this statesman here, with poems and with anecdotes, with figures too, this thinker, that soldier; all very brisk and clear; but at length the lane, the field, the common, the fruitful nut-tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of the road where he dismounted always, tied his horse to a tree, and proceeded on foot alone. He reached the edge of the lawn and looked out on the bay beneath.\n", "to come out thus on a spit of land which the sea is slowly eating away, and there to stand, like a desolate sea-bird, alone. It was his power, his gift, suddenly to shed all superfluities, to shrink and diminish so that he looked barer and felt sparer, even physically, yet lost none of his intensity of mind, and so to stand on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance, how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand on \u2013 that was his fate,\n", "how life, from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up with it and threw one down with it, there, with a dash on the beach.\n", "She was off like a bird, bullet, or arrow, impelled by what desire, shot by whom, at what directed, who could say? What, what? Mrs. Ramsay pondered, watching her. It might be a vision \u2013 of a shell, of a wheelbarrow, of a fairy kingdom on the far side of the hedge; or it might be the glory of speed; no one knew.\n", "\u2018Poor little place,\u2019 he murmured with a sigh. She heard him. He said the most melancholy things, but she noticed that directly he had said them he always seemed more cheerful than usual. All this phrase-making was a game, she thought, for if she had said half what he said, she would have blown her brains out by now. It annoyed her, this phrase-making, and she said to him, in a matter-of-fact way, that it was a perfectly lovely evening. And what was he groaning about, she asked, half laughing, half complaining, for she guessed what he was thinking \u2013 he would have written better books if he had not married.\n", "Nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves. She crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber-like sea anemones, who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock. Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down.\n", "all must be done to a turn.\n", "What damned rot they talk,\n", "he never let himself get into a groove. He had friends in all circles\u2026\n", "\u2018How you must detest dining in this bear garden,\u2019 she said, making use, as she did when she was distracted, of her social manner. So, when there is a strife of tongues at some meeting, the chairman, to obtain unity, suggests that every one shall speak in French. Perhaps it is bad French; French may not contain the words that express the speaker\u2019s thoughts; nevertheless speaking French imposes some order, some uniformity. Replying to her in the same language, Mr. Bankes said, \u2018No, not at all,\u2019 and Mr. Tansley, who had no knowledge of this language, even spoken thus in words of one syllable, at once suspected its insincerity. They did talk nonsense, he thought, the Ramsays; and he pounced on this fresh instance with joy, making a note which, one of these days, he would read aloud, to one or two friends. There, in a society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically describe \u2018staying with the Ramsays\u2019 and what nonsense they talked. It was worth while doing it once, he would say; but not again. The women bored one so, he would say. Of course Ramsay had dished himself by marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children. It would shape itself something like that, but now, at this moment, sitting stuck there with an empty seat beside him nothing had shaped itself at all. It was all in scraps and fragments.\n", "He felt extremely, even physically, uncomfortable. He wanted somebody to give him a chance of asserting himself. He wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his chair, looked at this person, then at that person, tried to break into their talk, opened his mouth and shut it again. They were talking about the fishing industry. Why did no one ask him his opinion? What did they know about the fishing industry? Lily Briscoe knew all that. Sitting opposite him could she not see, as in an X-ray photograph, the ribs and thigh bones of the young man\u2019s desire to impress himself lying dark in the mist of his flesh \u2013 that thin mist which convention had laid over his burning desire to break into the conversation? But, she thought, screwing up her Chinese eyes, and remembering how he sneered at women, \u2018can\u2019t paint, can\u2019t write\u2019, why should I help him to relieve himself? There is a code of behaviour she knew, whose seventh article (it may be) says that on occasions of this sort it behoves the woman, whatever her own occupation may be, to go to the help of the young man opposite so that he may expose and relieve the thigh bones, the ribs, of his vanity, of his urgent desire to assert himself; as indeed it is their duty, she reflected, in her old-maidenly fairness, to help us, suppose the Tube were to burst into flames. Then, she thought, I should certainly expect Mr. Tansley to get me out. But how would it be, she thought, if neither of us did either of these things? So she sat there smiling.\n", "She had done the usual trick \u2013 been nice. She would never know him. He would never know her. Human relations were all like that, she thought, and the worst (if it had not been for Mr. Bankes) were between men and women.\n", "There was a swirl of snow over the fields and the line where sky and earth met could not be seen."]
