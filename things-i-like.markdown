this is a list of things i encounter that i like that <a href="/cool_websites.html">aren't websites</a> and want to either share and/or say something about and/or find again later
</p>
<p>
because it's more fun to create an aesthetic object out of this urge than it is to post youtube links into the void on social media

<p>synth guys have the biggest fetish for aesthetics</p>

<p>this guy <em>Casper Electronics</em> is no less meticulous but there's a kind of intentional roughness in this fun and fast-paced demo of some basic sound-making circuitry that an algorithm accurately predicted i would respond positively to</p>

a transitional species between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_(band)">women-music</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(band)">weird ryhthm music.</a> it's less than 10 minutes long and each song has an amazingly taut structure. alongside the unexpectedly intriciate rhythm section and muffled production, there are a couple of tiny synth parts (e.g. 0:25 in <em>How to Become a Small Dead Dog</em>) that are, in my estimation, essential to its character.
