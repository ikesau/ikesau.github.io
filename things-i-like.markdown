this is a list of things i encounter that i like that <a href="/cool_websites.html">aren't websites</a> and want to either share and/or say something about and/or find again later
</p>
<p>
because it's more fun to create an aesthetic object out of this urge than it is to post youtube links into the void on social media

<p>synth guys have the biggest fetish for aesthetics</p>

<p>this guy <em>Casper Electronics</em> is no less meticulous but there's a kind of intentional roughness in this fun and fast-paced demo of some basic sound-making circuitry that an algorithm accurately predicted i would respond positively to</p>

a transitional species between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_(band)">women-music</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(band)">polyrhythm indie.</a> it's less than 10 minutes long and each song has an amazingly taut structure. alongside the muffled production and unexpectedly intriciate rhythm section, there are a couple of synth parts (e.g. 0:25 in <em>How to Become a Small Dead Dog</em>) that are, in my estimation, essential to its character.

a cute 'n' cohesive multimedia style meets the industrial might of a hustling 'n' grinding L.A. creative. it's cool to see the gradual distinction of his aesthetic over time in spite of many (very lovingly drawn) direct inspirations.
</p>
<p>does that make sense what i'm trying to say? even if someone starts out with "i want to create images that look like classic gossip magazines from the 90s", if they do it for long enough they'll blend enough new things in that the original mission statement won't be what they're making any more.
</p>
<p>it also helps that he works in <a href="https://everydaylouie.itch.io/toad-in-the-hole" style="color: #f66">many</a> <a href="https://louiezong.bandcamp.com/" style="color: #ce7f0e">different</a> <a href="https://www.louiezong.com/#/videos/" style="color: #eab50a">formats</a></p>
